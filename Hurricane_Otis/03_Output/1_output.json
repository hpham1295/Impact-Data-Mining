{"text_body": ["Hurricane Otis made landfall as a Category 5 hurricane near Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico at 6:25 UTC (12:25 AM local time) on October 25, 2023, surpassing Hurricane Patricia as the strongest landfalling Pacific hurricane on record, with measured wind speeds reaching 205 mph.", "Acapulco experienced significant damage, especially to residential and high-rise buildings along the coast.", "About 80% of the hotels in Acapulco were damaged, and about 274,000 homes were destroyed in the region.", "The unprecedented scale of damage to single- and multi-story buildings in low-lying regions of Acapulco resulted in dramatic failures to multiple glazing, cladding, and roof surfaces.", "These failures extended to nearly every high-rise structure in the nearshore region.", "Over half a million electricity consumers were affected.", "Meanwhile, roads, ports and air transit were disrupted, limiting egressing and access to the affected coastal city.", "The hurricane led to a reported 45 casualties and an estimated $15 billion in damage.", "In the aftermath, the Mexican government proposed a recovery strategy, emphasizing immediate rescue operations, financial support, and infrastructural restoration.", "This Preliminary Virtual Reconnaissance Report (PVRR) explores these topics as the primary product of StEER\u2019s Level 1 response to Hurricane Otis.", "overviewing of the hurricane, particularly relating to the wind and storm surge hazards and their impacts on the built environment, framing the regulatory environment and construction practices in the affected area, synthesizing preliminary reports of damage to buildings and other infrastructure, and providing recommendations for continued study of this event by StEER and the wider engineering reconnaissance community.", "Informed by the preliminary evidence compiled in this report, further research is needed to (1) characterize enhanced hurricane risk in a changing climate, where events historically atypical for this region may become commonplace, as will rapid intensifications such as those observed in Otis.", "This event will further support (2) ongoing study of extreme wind flow within urban canopies with important lessons to be learned for other (and even denser) urban coastal areas.", "This event also serves as a notable case study to (3) examine extreme wind performance of mid- and high-rise buildings assumed to be governed by seismic loads to advance our understanding of multi-hazard design.", "Meanwhile the extreme wind speeds observed in this event, if verified, can enable (4) validation of fragility and vulnerability models at the upper ranges of hazard intensity rarely observed to improve our overall damage and loss modeling capabilities.", "Finally, the topography in the region, when coupled with the heavy rains in this hurricane, provide notable cases of (5) flood-soil-structure interaction in hilly terrain.", "Based on the satisfaction of a majority of the escalation criteria, StEER\u2019s response to this event is escalated to a conditional Level 2, pending coordination with local officials and local researchers/practitioners to access impacted areas and capture perishable data through terrestrial and aerial imaging campaigns.", "Hurricane Otis made landfall as a Category 5 hurricane near Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico at 6:25 UTC (12:25 AM local time) on October 25, 2023 (NHC, 2023).", "According to the advisory archive of the National Hurricane Center (NHC), the low-pressure area was first noted on October 15, then elevated to a tropical depression by 15:00 UTC on October 22 and a Tropical storm by 22:00 UTC on the same day.", "The storm\u2019s intensification went from Category 1 (50 mph) in the early hours of October 24 to Category 5 (165mph) the next day (NHC, 2023).", "Preliminary records from a weather station belonging to Mexico's National Tidal Service of the Institute of Geophysics indicate that peak wind gusts of about 205 mph occurred in Acapulco (Dolce, 2023).", "In comparison to historical hurricane landfalls in Mexico based on sustained wind speeds, Hurricane Otis is the fourth-strongest, behind Hurricanes Janet (1955), Anita (1977), and Dean (2007).", "Hurricane Otis is the strongest hurricane to make landfall on Mexico\u2019s Pacific coast, surpassing Hurricane Patricia (2016).", "There were major forecast errors in the storm\u2019s category predictions and public advisories within 48 hours of landfall, as the rapid intensification of the storm was unexpected (Borenstein, 2023).", "Figure 1.1 shows NHC\u2019s 3-day forecast for Hurricane Otis, which anticipated landfall as a tropical storm.", "It is likely that this forecast gave residents a false sense of security and may have delayed or even negated their decisions to evacuate.", "Hurricane Otis left a trail of destruction in its wake, with powerful winds and intense rainfall, leading to widespread flooding and landslides across the region.", "One of the hardest-hit areas was the popular beach resort city of Acapulco, located on the Pacific coast of Mexico in the state of Guerrero.", "Acapulco, with a population of nearly 900,000, is the most populous city in the state and relies heavily on tourism, predominantly centered around its stunning bay area.", "The impact of Otis on residential infrastructure, particularly the high-rise buildings along the coast, is starkly evident in aerial photographs of the city, showcasing significant damage to the facades of numerous structures.", "Figure 1.2 shows damage to the cladding of a tall building on the coast of Acapulco.", "The extensive nature of building cladding damage in high-rise engineered structures was of a severity making this event an outlier among recent hurricane impacts of the past two decades.", "According to the governor of Guerrero, the hurricane caused damage to 80% of the hotels in Acapulco, a devastating blow to the city's tourism industry (Mega et al., 2023), with another approximately 274,000 houses destroyed (Reliefweb, 2023).", "The hurricane also took a toll on the region's essential services and infrastructure.", "The electric grid was severely affected, leaving 513,544 customers in the State of Guerrero without power in the aftermath of the hurricane's landfall.", "While efforts to restore power made progress, as of October 31, Mexico's Federal Electricity Commission reported that only 75% of the affected areas had their electricity service reinstated (CFE, 2023a).", "The hurricane's impact extended to communication networks as well, with phone lines and cellular phone service in the region being disrupted for a significant period, complicating emergency response and coordination.", "About 120 hospitals and 33 schools in the region were reported as damaged due to the hurricane event.", "As a result of these and other related factors, the Ministry of Education of Guerrero (SEG) decided to temporarily suspend academic activities in Acapulco and Coyuca de Benitez from October 30 to November 3 (Reliefweb, 2023).", "Furthermore, road closures and the inability to access the airport due to landslides created additional challenges, causing delays in planned government and military interventions in the affected areas.", "Acapulco's ports were forced to close during the hurricane, disrupting not only local trade and transportation but also the city's economic activities, which rely heavily on tourism.", "Reports emerged of a shortage of food and drinking water following the hurricane, primarily due to the late arrival of aid and insufficient supplies.", "Many grocery stores remained closed, severely limiting access to essential food items and leaving residents in a precarious position (Mega et al., 2023).", "The financial implications of the hurricane's devastation are substantial.", "According to Enki Research, the cost of Hurricane Otis could potentially reach as high as $15 billion, underlining the extensive damage and disruption caused by this hurricane (Romero and Ore, 2023).", "Additionally, one of the most salient impacts of the hurricane has been the widespread displacement of families.", "It was estimated that approximately 250,000 families have been left homeless because of Hurricane Otis, according to Mexico\u2019s President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (Rivera, 2023).", "High winds and flooding pose a significant risk to the impacted community.", "Hurricane Otis, unfortunately, followed this pattern, resulting in a significant human toll.", "According to the Governor of Guerrero state, 45 people died and 47 are missing as of October 31 (Cohen, 2023).", "Tragically, preparedness, early warnings, and effective evacuations, which could have helped minimize the casualties, were all absent during this event.", "In part, this can be attributed to the failure of the NHC forecast system to anticipate the rapid intensification of the storm over warm ocean surface waters along the West coast of Mexico.", "On the 1st of November 2023, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador revealed a support and recovery plan for the victims of Hurricane Otis.", "The general plan included rebuilding and supporting the population in Acapulco, and in the nearby city of Coyuca de Benitez, both devastated by the hurricane on October 25 (Garrison and O\u2019Boyle, 2023).", "The federal government will also reserve about $3.4 billion to implement the plan (Garrison and O\u2019Boyle, 2023).", "The plan, which is composed of 20 steps, will prioritize the search for missing persons, accelerate financial support for the elderly and people with disabilities, and guarantee the support of local producers and fishermen.", "The government suspended electricity payments from November 2023 to February 2024 and called for the delivery of basic foods to the estimated 250,000 families impacted by the event.", "Additionally, a budget will be reserved to repair houses and a package of household goods will be delivered to the victims, which includes a bed, stove, fan, and set of dishes, among other items.", "Mexico is expected to receive between $30 million and $60 million from a catastrophe bond that insures the country against earthquakes and hurricanes, according to the finance minister Gabriel Yorio.", "He also said that Mexico has additional insurance funds available that can be used for rebuilding purposes (Garrison and O\u2019Boyle, 2023).", "StEER activated a Level 1 response to evaluate this event, with a Virtual Assessment Structural Team (VAST) formed on October 25, 2023, based on the event having the strong potential to generate new knowledge (evidenced by achieving more than 50% of the activation criteria in Table 1.1).", "The official response page was then instituted on the StEER website.", "The VAST was charged with the production of this Preliminary Virtual Reconnaissance Report (PVRR).",

the affected area, synthesizing preliminary reports of damage to buildings and other infrastructure, and providing recommendations for continued study of this event by StEER and the wider engineering reconnaissance community.", "Tropical Storm Otis formed on Sunday, October 22, 2023, and, based on model runs that evening local time, was predicted by the US National Hurricane Center to make landfall in the state of Guerrero near the city of Acapulco as a tropical storm (Fig.2.1).", "Twenty-four hours later, the forecast remained largely unchanged, with landfall still predicted as a tropical storm, although the NHC 10 pm Discussion Number 7 mentioned the possibility of rapid intensification given the notable low-level structure and warm sea surface temperatures.", "Within 24 hours, that threat fully materialized with sustained winds in Otis increasing by 120 mph to bring it to Category 5 status by Tuesday night (October 24).", "Otis made landfall just over 24 hours later, at 12:25 AM local time.", "The maximum sustained winds were estimated to be 165 mph (270 km/hr), Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, and the minimum central pressure was estimated to be 923 mb.", "The radius to maximum winds was estimated at around 15 nautical miles at landfall by the RAMMB Tropical Cyclone real-time analysis platform, and hurricane-force winds extended up to 30 miles (48 km) out from the center according to NHC advisories.", "After landfall, Otis rapidly weakened as it moved inland over Mexico until it dissipated around 4 PM local time.", "Figure 2.2 shows Hurricane Otis at landfall based on water vapor as measured by the GOES-16 clean infrared product at 12:20 AM local time.", "A clear eye and symmetric storm structure is visible, indicating Otis remained a powerful hurricane through landfall.", "Several permanent weather stations recorded the near-surface wind field throughout the passage of Hurricane Otis.", "However, StEER is unaware of the pre-deployment of any mobile surface measurement stations in Mexico.", "Remarkably, a Tidal Gauge Station located atop a pier at the Acapulco Terminal Maritina recorded a maximum 3-second average gust of 205 mph (330 km/hr) from the northeast.", "The station included a sonic anemometer positioned approximately 20 ft above water level.", "While verification of the measurement is still underway, if it stands, this measurement would be among the ten strongest near-surface wind gusts ever directly measured on Earth.", "Two other stations also measured the passage of Hurricane Otis near landfall, one on the island of Roqueta and the other (El Veladero) further inland, on the outskirts of Acapulco.", "Few details are available on these stations at this time - only that the Isla Roqueta station is owned and operated by the Mexican Secretary of the Navy, and the El Veladero station is an automated weather station owned and operated by the National Meteorological Service of Mexico.", "Based on the provided locations, both stations appear to be in relatively built-up terrain with potential topographic effects influencing the wind and pressure measurements.", "In Figure 2.3, pressures have been adjusted to sea level using the elevation factor in ASCE 7.", "Further investigation, including site visits, of these stations would be beneficial to understanding the near-surface wind field.", "Little information is available at this time about the level of storm surge and coastal flooding induced by Hurricane Otis.", "Only two tidal stations were in the vicinity of the landfall region according to the National Meteorological Service of Mexico - one in the area of the Yacht Club (GPS: 16.837, -99.904), and the other being the Acapulco API station (GPS: 16.84867, -99.90067) that was the source of the wind measurements described in Section 2.2.", "Only the data from the latter was able to be recovered, and it showed a minimal storm surge of about 1.5 ft (45 cm) occurred between midnight and 2:00 AM local time, which was near low tide.", "Water levels with the surge were similar to normal high tide levels, and no evidence of significant storm surge impacts was available at the time of this report (Fig.2.4).", "While Otis was a powerful Category 5 wind storm when it made landfall, the limited storm surge is likely due to the rapid intensification occurring just before landfall.", "This limits the duration of high wind speeds that would contribute to development of storm surge and large waves.", "The surge was relatively low with a maximum of 1.5 feet (45 centimeters), which occurred during the low tide period.", "Maximum water heights in Acapulco were only slightly higher than mean high tide levels (Source: Servicio Mareogr\u00e1fico Nacional UNAM).", "No rain gauge data from stations in the proximity of the landfall region have been found at the time of this report.", "There are also no weather radar stations in the proximity of landfall, with the nearest radar located in Mexico City, nearly 185 miles (300 km) away.", "Satellite-derived accumulated rainfall estimates (Fig.2.5) showed between 100-125 mm (4-5 inches) of total rainfall associated with Hurricane Otis in portions of the state of Guerrero over 24 hours ending at 3:00 PM local time (9:00 PM UTC).", "The heavy rainfall led to multiple reports of mudslides, particularly in the mountainous outskirts of Acapulco and surrounding regions.", "Designs of tall buildings in Acapulco have traditionally focused on seismic resistance due to significant past earthquakes in the region, e.g., an M7.0 earthquake struck Acapulco as recently as September 2021 (USGS, 2021), and the few major hurricanes in recent history.", "One of these major hurricanes, Hurricane Pauline, hit the city of Acapulco in 1997 and killed about 260 people.", "This hurricane was one of the deadliest Pacific hurricanes to make landfall in Mexico.", "Hurricane Pauline destroyed a great number of buildings, channels, culverts, streets, bridges, water pipes and sewers.", "This hurricane emphasized the importance of a master plan for stormwater drainage as well as the need for continued maintenance of all hydraulic facilities.", "Mapping of natural hazards and banning of houses and sensitive installations from risky terrain were integral parts of the ensuing risk management strategy; however, other aspects in building codes were not strengthened (Spang et al., 2003).", "In fact, building codes, permitting and regulations, including design requirements, vary widely across Mexico\u2019s 31 states and almost 2,500 municipalities (Alcocer and Castano, 2008).", "Each municipality is entitled by the Mexican Constitution to establish appropriate regulations, meaning that each has the power to issue its own local building code or may adopt a state building code or other design standards (e.g., ASCE 7, ACI 318, AISC).", "Unfortunately, a 2018 report claimed that 93% of Mexico\u2019s municipalities have no construction regulations (MND, 2018).", "As such, it is not surprising to find that many of the communities affected by Hurricane Otis lacked construction regulations, so much so that significant portions of the housing in these areas were without necessities such as drainage, toilets/latrines, and electricity (Obras Redacci\u00f3n, 2023).", "The municipality of Acapulco does have building regulations in place, which were last updated in 2002.", "While Acapulco also requires inspections by qualified officials to be carried out during construction and after construction has been completed (World Bank, 2016), the extent to which these regulations are enforced is unknown.", "Wind resistance requirements are specified by the Acapulco Construction Regulations Chapter VII, which segregates buildings into Group A (critical facilities/essential infrastructure) and Group B (housing, offices, hotels, commercial, industrial).", "Most buildings fall into Group B, which requires a design wind speed of 93 mph (150 km/hr) in the coastal areas, and 62 mph (100 km/hr) further inland1.", "The Acapulco Regulations only specify importance factors, based on the building group, for the quantification of seismic load.", "Thus, the wind speeds correspond to a 50-year recurrence interval.", "The Construction Regulations require the wind loads to be combined with other loads using a load factor of 1.1, but load combinations are not explicitly provided.", "In addition to the Acapulco Construction Regulations, conversations with local practicing engineers suggest that wind designs of buildings and other structures sometimes follow the Federal Commission for Electricity (CFE) Manual for Design of Civil Works (CFE, 2020), a national standard that includes wind design recommendations such as design wind speeds and wind pressure modification procedures.", "The CFE Manual has been adopted as the Complementary Technical Standards in some municipalities by explicit ordinances.", "For Acapulco, the 2020 CFE manual recommends a 50-year recurrence interval wind speed of 141 km/hr (88 mph), in contrast to and 150 km/hr (93 mph) in the 2008 version.", "As a result of having multiple methods for developing wind loads, and the lack of clarity in combining load cases with appropriate load factors, it is unclear what reliabilities are targeted for wind design.", "Tables 4.1 and 4.2 provide a synthesis of the typical performance of buildings in this event, organized by occupancy and geography.", "The subsections that follow present notable case studies.",

cataloged by occupancy.", "Acapulco witnessed an unprecedented scale of damage to single- and multi-story buildings.", "In low-lying regions of Acapulco, high winds dominated the structural responses, inducing failures to multiple glazing, cladding, and roof surfaces.", "These failures extended to nearly every high-rise structure in the nearshore region.", "On the other hand, low-rise structures experienced significant roof damage as well as flooding caused by rainwater.", "In elevated regions of Acapulco, rainwater caused mudslides and foundation failures in single-story structures.", "Acapulco witnessed severe damage to residential structures.", "Aerial photographs of the residential area in Coyuca de Benitez (located approximately 16 miles northwest of Acapulco) revealed extensive damage to roofs, walls, foundations, and various structural and architectural features (Fig.4.1).", "The impact of blown-off roofs and walls led to widespread flooding inside houses due to water infiltration.", "The damage was associated with high wind loads on roofs and walls, floodwaters, and wind-borne debris.", "The extent of the damage to single-family residential homes in Acapulco is lacking at this point due to limited media coverage.", "Based on limited satellite imagery and a few social media posts, damage appears to be widespread but dependent on the structure type, with lower-income housing with wood framing and corrugated panels suffering widespread damage.", "Acapulco City sits along the coast of Acapulco Bay and boasts numerous hotels, resorts, and condominiums.", "There was unprecedented damage to the building envelopes (e.g., glazing and cladding) of many structures due to the wind loads, though the lateral force-resisting structural systems appeared to perform adequately.", "Some window failures would be expected due to wind-borne debris, but generally limited to the lower levels of the buildings.", "However, in this case, many buildings experienced total exterior glazing loss over the full height of the building.", "Many buildings now display damaged roofs, loss of glazing, and failure of exterior wall cladding as a result.", "Examples of modern high-rise residential buildings such as the recently completed Mare Acapulco Diamante (Fig.4.2), and the Diamante condominiums (Fig.4.3) show extensive loss of glazing over the entire exterior of the buildings.", "The Mare Acapulco Diamante building was completed in 2023, the Diamante condominiums were constructed between 2006 and 2009, and the Princess Mundo Hotel was built circa 1971.", "Despite the significant age gap, all displayed extensive levels of damage to multiple floors.", "This is surprising considering the advancements in building codes and standards that should have been taken into account during their respective constructions.", "Currently, there is no confirmation regarding the actual wind speed for which these buildings were designed.", "Figure 4.4 shows three screenshots from a video of the damage caused to the Solar Ocean building.", "The first image shows a view from the unprotected balcony towards two adjacent buildings with similar exterior curtain wall failures.", "The middle image shows the interior of the unit with all glazing missing, severe damage to the ceiling and interior walls, and water damage to all contents of the dwelling unit.", "The third image shows an exterior view confirming the exterior failure over the full building height.", "Figure 4.5 shows the interior of the Princess Mundo Hotel, which lost the roof glazing over the large atrium.", "The Galerias Mall is one of the most severely damaged structures in the aftermath of Hurricane Otis (Fig.4.6).", "The shopping mall encompasses commercial and shopping stores that experienced substantial damage to its roof, curtain walls, and glass cladding panels.", "Light framed commercial properties along the coastline in Puerto Marqu\u00e9s Bay provide evidence of damage due to wind and breaking waves (Fig.4.7).", "In addition, the Arena GNP Seguros (Fig.4.8) suffered severe wind damage.", "Tables 5.1 and 5.2 provide a synthesis of the typical performance of other infrastructure classes in this event, organized by class and geography.", "The subsections that follow present notable case studies.", "Readers may consult the imagery compiled in the accompanying

disruption/outage/restoration of power, telecommunications, and transportation networks.", "Notably main roads connecting Acapulco to the interior of Mexico, e.g., Mexico City, were blocked by debris and landslides; the port was inoperable, and the airport was closed.", "All means for leaving or supplying the affected region after the hurricane were extremely limited.", "CFE deployed numerous resources for restoration efforts summarized in Table 5.3.", "These included 2,900 electrical workers, 283 cranes, 875 vehicles, 147 emergency plants, 38 lighting towers and 7 helicopters.", "The cranes and helicopters were needed to repair fallen towers and lines in hard-to-access terrain.", "According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs on October 26th, roads were so severely damaged that communities in the Acapulco area could not be accessed for restoration and recovery efforts.", "In addition, the main highway between Acapulco and Mexico City was inaccessible.", "As of November 7, locals reported that about 50% of the roads were accessible but with military restrictions.", "Only the military, aid vehicles, Mexican media, and people showing residency in Acapulco are allowed to enter Acapulco under military escort.", "Reports of road washouts were common in the more mountainous regions surrounding Acapulco, e.g., in the municipality of Kilmetro 42, Guerrero, Mexico, part of a road washed away (Fig.5.1).", "Roadway damage also limited access to critical facilities such as the Acapulco Airport whose entrance road was blocked by debris (Fig.5.2).", "Although the road signs and power poles were severely damaged, the \u201cstand-alone\u201d untethered tower in the background appears to be intact.", "The trees on the right-hand side of
