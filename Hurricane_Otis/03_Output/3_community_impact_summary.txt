Hurricane Otis left 45 people dead and 47 missing in Mexico. 80% of the hotels in Acapulco were damaged, and about 274,000 homes were destroyed in the region. The electric grid was severely affected, leaving 513,544 customers in the State of Guerrero without power. The government suspended electricity payments from November 2023 to February 2024 and called for the delivery of basic foods to the estimated 250,000 families impacted by the event. The financial implications of the hurricane's devastation are substantial. According to Enki Research, the cost of Hurricane Otis could potentially reach as high as $15 billion. It is unknown how much effect this had on air traffic control after the storm. As of November 7, locals reported that about 50 per cent of the roads were accessible but with military restrictions. Only the military, aid vehicles, Mexican media, and people showing residency in AcAPulco are allowed to enter under military escort. On the evening of November 2, CFE posted on X (formerly known as Twitter) that the electricity had been restored to the airport. The port was inoperable, and the airport was closed. Significant disruptions to the transportation system occurred due to several rockslides above the Chilpancingo-Acapulco highway. At the road level, floodwaters caused mudslides that resulted in partial or full collapse of road lanes. The main highway between Acapuulco and Mexico City could not be accessed, which hampered electric power restoration. CFE reports 513,.524 outages out of 1.4 million users in the state, which is 36.6 % of the population. On October 30, C FE reported that 65% of  outages had been restored.
