In particular, the ground motion in Hatay was multiple times larger than the MCE levels.", "This explains the widespread destruction observed in this city.", "Another major factor that might have contributed to the collapse of some relatively newer structures that were supposed to be earthquake-resistant is the cascading hazard effect from the strong aftershocks, especially the second earthquake of Mw 7.6.", "Several mid-rise buildings that survived the main shock (per the design intent), collapsed during the Mw 7.6 earthquake.", "It is likely that damage and inelastic behavior caused by the Mw 7.7 earthquake weakened these buildings.", "Strong aftershocks and the second major event within a few hours of the mainshock imposed large demands on the already \u201cplastic\u201d structures with significant strength and stiffness degradation.", "In the N-S direction, the spectral accelerations exceed 1g for periods of 1.00 to 2.00 s with the potential of causing heavy damage in high-rise buildings (10 stories and higher).", "This aligns with reports that \u201cthe downtown district with taller buildings was hit particularly hard, while residential areas outside the city center had less apparent destruction\u201d (Abraham et al.2023).", "Comparing the response spectra at TK.4612 with the hazard spectra indicates that observed shaking exceeds the DBE level hazard spectra (10% exceedance in 50 years, or 475-year return period) at almost all periods and exceeds the MCE level hazard spectra (2% exceedance in 50 years, or 2475-year return period) at all periods above about 0.50 s. Engineered structures that are designed to resist seismic forces are typically designed to prevent collapse at MCE-level shaking.", "As a result, tall buildings at this location that would have been engineered to prevent collapse at MCE levels could experience heavy damage or collapse in this earthquake given that the shaking exceeded the MCE levels by a factor of 2 to 3 for certain periods.", "The impact of the earthquake sequence on buildings is clearly location dependent.", "As a result, engineered buildings at this location may be able to withstand this shaking without collapse, albeit while sustaining moderate to heavy damage.", "As discussed above, high shaking levels as shown by the response spectra, structural system degradation during long duration of shaking from the two main events and aftershocks, and the occurrence of the earthquake sequence with strong multiple aftershocks, should all be considered altogether.", "The use of ready mixed concrete and deformed reinforcement bars became more widespread.", "Based on these developments, the buildings constructed after 2000 are assumed to have enhanced quality and considered to be less vulnerable to earthquake events.", "Building data from T\u00dcIK and field studies in Gaziantep city, where the first earthquake hit, reveal that almost two-thirds of the residential buildings are masonry and one-third are Reinforced Concrete (RC).", "Most masonry buildings are 1 to 2 story structures, whereas RC buildings are mostly 1 to 4 stories, although some mid-rise and high-rise buildings exist.", "Most of the buildings built between 1980 and 2000 are regarded as non- or low-engineered structures.", "However, there is evidence that even post-2000 and post-2007, RC and masonry buildings were not properly designed and detailed for adequate ductility and seismic resistance.", "According to the observations from previous earthquakes, insufficient engineering design and construction quality are major contributing reasons for the failure of buildings in T\u00fcrkiye during recent earthquakes.", "These deficiencies are manifest in many undesirable structural flaws, such as weak column-strong beam, soft-story, non-ductile detailing of structural members and connections, lack of strength of lateral load carrying systems, and discontinuous frames.", "Moreover, removal of the load carrying system members, insufficient geotechnical site investigations, and poor foundation design can be added to the reasons for the observed damage of structural systems.", "Furthermore, permits were granted to recently registered buildings of less than 6 stories to allow construction of additional stories (up to 6) despite being non-engineered buildings with unknown column and foundation capacity.", "Those additional floors were built completely from hollow concrete block bearing walls, and solid slabs that are 60 to 80 mm thick with no beams and insufficient reinforcing bars.", "In this case, as-built conditions were substantially different from the structural drawings.", "For instance, the local special moment frames were usually built with substandard quality, reinforcement quantity and details, such as using smaller diameter reinforcing bars or even removing the reinforcement totally from some members.", "It is reasonable to assume that most building stock in the earthquake affected areas is non-ductile concrete systems with masonry infill walls or unreinforced bearing masonry wall systems.", "The non-ductile concrete systems for multi-story low-rise and mid-rise buildings are either beam and slab gravity frames (may be designed for wind loads in some cases) or flat plates or ribbed/joisted slabs with hollow blocks with no or shallow spandrel beams.", "It is noteworthy that the ribbed slabs with no projected/drop beams and the flat plates, in the absence of seismic design and structural walls, are most vulnerable to severe damage and collapse even with moderate earthquake shaking.", "The multi-story low-rise and mid-rise non-ductile concrete systems in Northern Syria are evidently thin joist slabs with hollow blocks or flat plates, with no drop beams and no or very shallow spandrel beams that are slightly deeper than the slabs.", "Columns are apparently thin with extremely low reinforcement ratios, small diameter reinforcing bars and poor confinement (refer to Figure 3.3).", "These buildings appear to be non-engineered or poorly engineered at best with no shear walls, perhaps built post 2011 war.", "Concrete quality appears low from inspection of damaged photographs.", "For the low-rise buildings (1 to 2 stories) in these areas, unreinforced masonry seems more common.", "Similar practices can be observed in other Syrian areas, except that buildings have more stories.", "The buildings are older and the use of slab and beam non-ductile concrete frames with infill walls and the unreinforced bearing wall masonry system (both are considered the mainstream construction methods in pre-2011 era) seem to be more common.", "Moreover, no shear walls can be observed in any building type.", "In this section, typical building damage and collapses are documented, organized by occupancy for residential, commercial, government facilities, schools, hospitals, religious, and historical buildings.", "Many buildings collapsed, partially collapsed, or were severely damaged in this earthquake sequence.", "According to data from the T\u00fcrkiye Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change as of February 19, the number of buildings in different damaged states are listed in Table 4.1 for nine of the impacted cities in T\u00fcrkiye.", "Figures 4.1 and 4.2 show the map of collapsed, partially collapsed, and severely damaged buildings in several cities in T\u00fcrkiye.", "In Syria, severe building damages and hundreds of building collapses resulted from the two main events and the aftershocks in Northern Syria.", "More than 22,000 buildings were affected by the events.", "At the time of publication of this report, damage assessment by structural engineers in Syria has provided preliminary rapid visual assessment numbers of the \u201cred-tagged\u201d unsafe buildings to be demolished as 400 buildings in Northern Syria and 275 buildings in other areas.", "While there are numerous photographs and videos documenting the damage experienced by single- and multi-family residential buildings following the earthquake sequence, this section presents selected cases that represent observed typical failure mechanisms.", "Several single-family and mixed-use multi-family RC buildings collapsed due to the presence of soft/weak first stories.", "The first story of the 5-story building in Figure 4.4 is much taller than the other stories, leading to a soft story.", "The intact columns of the collapsed building in the above stories show that most of the lateral displacements concentrated at the soft first story, resulting in eventual collapse of the structure.", "It is observed that the adjacent building, with glass fa\u00e7ades at the first two stories, has also high potential to have soft stories because of the glass fa\u00e7ades or openings at the first two stories and the infill walls at the upper stories.", "This adjacent building has not collapsed.", "The differences in the concrete and reinforcing bar strength, quantity, and detailing could be the reasons why one building collapsed and the adjacent one did not.", "However, another reason can be the potential pounding of the first floor of the standing building at a location above the mid-height of the first story corner column of the collapsed building.", "This additional shear force could have led to the collapse of the corner column, leading to a progressive collapse.", "Another set of adjacent buildings with inadequate seismic gap is shown in Figure 4.5, where one of the buildings collapsed.", "Insufficient seismic gap results in increased damage when the adjacent buildings have different periods (e.g., due to different number of stories) and the consequent pounding of buildings due to the asynchronous motions.", "Collapse of weak/soft story (due to glass fa\u00e7ades of stores at the first story) of adjacent buildings with different number of stories and with insufficient seismic gap is observed in Figure 4.6.", "The building in Figure 4.7 has larger openings at the first story, with infill walls at the upper stories, resulting in a weak and soft first story.", "It is observed that the first two stories of this building collapsed, where the second story collapse likely occurred due to the impact of the first story collapse.", "Out of plane wall failures in all stories of the exterior bay indicate larger accelerations experienced by these walls due to torsional irregularity and the twist of the building.", "This building collapsed after the second earthquake (Mw 7.5 in Elbistan).", "The 6-story building in Figure 4.8 is a mixed-use building with a pharmacy and a grocery store at the first story, and residential occupancies at the upper stories.", "The window openings at the first story and the infill walls at the upper stories resulted in a weak and soft first story, leading to collapse of the first story.", "It is likely that the first story glass fa\u00e7ades were only at the front of the building, with infill walls at the back and sides.", "This nonuniform distribution of infill walls around the perimeter could have increased the torsional response during ground shaking.", "The 7-story mixed use RC building in Figure 4.9 likely collapsed due to similar reasons as indicated for the collapse of the 6-story mixed use building in Figure 4.8.", "It is located on a street corner with shopfront openings on both streets, and presumably solid fire walls on the back sides of the building.", "The torsional effects during ground shaking would impose large shear and bending demands on the front corner column (yellow color in Figure 4.9a).", "The video of this event indicates that failure of this column initiated total collapse of the building.", "RC frames with unreinforced masonry infill walls is a common structural topology in T\u00fcrkiye.", "In low levels of excitation, these infill walls add to the stiffness and strength of the structure, providing beneficial contributions.", "However, even in cases where the infill walls are uniformly distributed along the height of the structure and there are no initial soft or weak stories, brittle failure of the infill walls due to in-plane/out-of-plane interaction can lead to the formation of soft stories during an earthquake (G\u00fcnay and Mosalam 2015), leading to eventual collapse.", "Considering the two strong earthquakes (Mw 7.8 and Mw 7.5) and the aftershocks between them, the formation of soft stories due to infill walls in the first event could have led to the collapse of these structures during the second event, as shown in Figures 4.4 to 4.10.", "It is noted that the infill walls of the collapsed buildings discussed above were not isolated from the bounding frames, which is the main reason why the infill walls were an important factor in the formation of weak and soft stories.", "Although the current version of the TBSC includes provisions for the inclusion of the infill walls for identification of vertical irregularities and suggests methods for isolating the infill walls from the frames, such isolation and inclusion of infill walls in numerical models are not required.", "Revisions in the TBSC for explicit consideration of infill walls and their isolation from the frames should be revisited.", "In some of the collapsed buildings, it is possible that the presence of soft and weak stories is accompanied by other characteristics of low ductility response (e.g., inadequate seismic detailing such as lack of confinement at the beam- and column-ends and insufficient transverse reinforcement at beam-column joints).", "The particular issue with the detrimental effects of infill walls at large shaking is not specific to only T\u00fcrkiye.", "In addition to their effect on the stiffness of upper stories, masonry infill walls, both at the exterior and interior walls of each floor, add considerable mass to the building, resulting in larger inertial forces developed during ground shaking.", "Poor behavior of RC frame structures with masonry infill walls was observed in several previous earthquakes in the world as well (Braga et al.2011; Manfredi et al.2014; Marinkovi\u0107 et al.2022).", "The 7-story building on a 2-story podium in Figure 4.12 is a mixed-use building, where the podium is used as a commercial space and the 7-story building has residential units.", "The first story of the podium structure has glass fa\u00e7ades and is weaker and softer than the second story of the podium.", "This is a potential reason for the collapse of this building.", "As observed from the right figure, all stories of the 7-story building collapsed, likely due to the impact of the podium collapse.", "The 2-story buildings in Figure 4.13 might have collapsed due to the combined effect of soft and weak stories and accompanying torsional response.", "An important reason for the collapses in the earthquake sequence is that such buildings were subjected to two large magnitude earthquakes (Mw 7.8 and Mw 7.5) and major aftershocks in between.", "Figure 4.14 shows a severely damaged building after the first earthquake that continued to collapse hours later during an aftershock putting at risk the lives of first responders.", "Therefore, the buildings in the region can be categorized as pre-2000 (not up to date with modern seismic codes) and post-2000 (supposed to be designed according to the modern principles of seismic design).", "There is evidence that even post-2000 and post-2007 RC and masonry buildings collapsed.", "As noted earlier, there are several reasons for these collapses, including: (a) the ground motions exceeding MCE levels, (b) several large motions experienced by the buildings back-to-back in a sequence, (c) possibility of buildings not designed according to the code, and (d) possibility of the construction and material quality not following the intended design.", "Regarding the last two reasons, when buildings are designed as seismically resistant, some degree of repairable damage is expected due to higher earthquake levels than what was considered in the design of these buildings.", "However, when the shaking level significantly exceeds the design levels as the case here in this earthquake sequence, details of construction become a major factor to distinguish between collapse and other levels of damage.", "An RC residential building with shear walls, newly constructed in 2022, had a catastrophic collapse as shown in before and after images in Figure 4.15.", "Another new residential RC building with shear walls collapsed while it was under construction (Figure 4.16).", "In this figure, shear walls are oriented along one direction of the building.", "Extensive concrete crushing is visible at the shear wall base, denoting sliding-shear failure, as well as diagonal concrete crushing (e.g., refer to the third wall after the corner column), suggesting a combined flexure-shear diagonal failure.", "Furthermore, an axial failure of a corner beam-column joint is visible, with a possible under-design or shortage of sufficient confinement.", "Significant beam yielding along the orthogonal direction to the building lateral collapse in the shear wall direction might have led to shear and axial failure of the joint.", "Another building that has collapsed on its side is shown in Figure 4.17.", "There are several potential reasons for this failure: (1) Inadequate foundation, or (2) Initiation of the collapse of the structure from one side, resulting in the toppling of the structure.", "It is noted that this type of collapse due to the second reason is known as sidesway collapse, which occurs due to lateral dynamic instability at large lateral displacements, when the lateral strength of the structure degrades significantly.", "This type of collapse is different from the ones discussed in earlier images, where the RC buildings mostly collapsed by losing gravity load carrying capacity, much before reaching these excessive lateral displacements.", "The sidesway collapse might have occurred in buildings with larger displacement capacities, which have been exceeded by the large demands in this earthquake sequence, while the gravity collapse occurred in buildings with less deformation capacity (ductility) due to presence of vertical irregularities, insufficient confinement, weak-column/strong-beam proportions, or other characteristics of nonductile concrete buildings.", "In addition to the numerous failures shown above, Figure 4.19 (b) and (c) show that half of a 15- story mixed-use concrete building collapsed by separation from the other half.", "This collapse was reported to occur after a Mw 6.1 aftershock.", "From the top view of the building, an excessive reentrant corner can be seen in the middle.", "This reentrant corner could have led to excessive stress concentrations at that portion of the building (FEMA-P154, 2012).", "This may have caused the splitting of one half of the building from the other contributing to the collapse of the split half.", "It is also noted that the same reentrant corner is present in similar buildings in the neighborhood that are standing, hinting at possible other structural issues of this collapsed building.", "Another partially collapsed building is shown in Figure 4.20.", "It is possible that the failure in the corner of this building took place due to a combined effect of the two horizontal components of the ground motions at the location of the building.", "Increased shear forces due to plan torsion irregularity could have contributed to the occurrence of such failure.", "As discussed in Section 3, it is likely that most building stock in the earthquake impacted regions in Syria is non-engineered, poorly engineered, or at best gravity-designed non-ductile systems.", "The heaviest damage and the most collapses occurred in 4 cities in Syria (Aleppo, Latakia, Idlib, and Hama) and in 40 towns and villages in Northern Syria (Idlib) and its countryside (Reef Idlib), Aleppo and its countryside (Reef Aleppo)), with the most damage concentrated in Jendeyres near Afrin, and Harem near Idlib.", "As mentioned in Section 3, non-ductile concrete frames, non-ductile concrete ribbed slabs with hollow blocks and no drop beams, and non-ductile concrete flat plates are the most common RC systems for mid-rise buildings (all RC systems included heavy masonry infills) while the unreinforced masonry bearing walls is more common in low-rise buildings up to 6 stories.", "Many buildings in Syria that were damaged during the war are believed to have been rebuilt by individuals with low-quality materials.", "Such buildings are expected to be more vulnerable to collapse from earthquake shaking (Naddaf 2023; Mroue and Chehaeb 2023).", "There is past evidence of the collapse of war-damaged residential buildings in Aleppo and consequential casualties (Reuters 2023b).", "It is unfortunate that the ground motion records by the Syrian stations are not available by the time of publication of this report to help correlate damage to ground motion site spectra.", "Several unreinforced masonry multi-family buildings (low-rise and mid-rise) collapsed with a soft-story mechanism or out-of-plane (OOP) masonry failure as presented in Figures 4.21 to 4.23 (refer to shown arrows).", "Moreover, video evidence showed OOP failure of masonry infills leading to structural collapse.", "Non-ductile concrete construction presented severe damage and collapse in many instances and was believed to have caused the most fatalities and injuries.", "In some cases, a non-ductile concrete system is mixed with an unreinforced masonry bearing wall system within the same building, especially for the purpose of adding more floors to an existing building (refer to the building in the red rectangle in Figure 4.26).", "Severe damage before complete collapse due to low-quality materials made it sometimes difficult to distinguish from the debris a skeleton RC structure from a bearing wall system.", "For instance, while the rubble in Figure 4.26 may suggest all masonry construction, evidence of a few RC columns can still be detected as in the highlighted blue rectangle.", "It is evident from the partial collapse photographs that some older buildings in Syria were constructed with no gap to neighboring buildings of the same height, perhaps using the neighboring building as formwork for concrete elements (Figures 4.22, 4.23 and 4.27), which may have helped avoiding total collapse or preventing collapse in some instances.", "Pounding effects may have been relatively reduced due to such configurations.", "The diaphragm (floor slab) failure was commonly observed in many buildings (Figures 4.27 to 4.29, 4.32 and 4.33) when the horizontal diaphragm is unable to resist lateral forces during strong shaking or it is separated from the vertical system due to anchorage failure.", "The absence of slab integrity reinforcement, lack of continuity reinforcement, and poor anchorage to columns are evident in these figures.", "Very vulnerable slab-column connection conditions resulted from the absence of beams along with poor anchorage to columns, and in many instances, it is speculated that the collapse sequence was triggered by these vulnerable connections, as shown in the red rectangles in Figure 4.28.", "Pancaked collapse of multi-story non-ductile concrete buildings with ribbed slabs and no drop beams was widespread in Syria, more evident in Northern Syria\u2019s newer buildings constructed post 2012 war from low-quality materials as explained in Section 3 (Figures 4.28 to 4.35).", "Newer unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings also suffered extreme damage or collapse.", "On the other hand, old buildings of 2 to 3 stories in Syria (even made from adobe or stone masonry) resisted the strong shaking well, with some cracks and light damage, likely due to relatively higher quality of construction and materials prior to 2012.", "In concrete buildings that experienced severe damage or partial or total collapse, some common deficiencies can be observed from the collapse photographs, most of which are common in non- ductile concrete buildings, but some are considered excessive due to poor construction quality.", "Concrete quality/strength appears very low by visual inspection of texture and color, as well as the severity of crushing following collapse.", "Syrian engineers contacted after the event confirmed the low quality of the concrete used.", "Thin RC column sections, suggesting no seismic design was conducted, and even in some cases appearing to be under-designed for gravity loads.", "This is common in non- engineered buildings.", "Thin columns can be observed in many damaged buildings; examples are seen in Figures 4.26 to 4.29, 4.31, and 4.32.", "Many buildings had lightly reinforced column sections, with no or little transverse reinforcement, and potentially inadequate lap splices located immediately above the slabs.", "Absence of drop (projected) beams below the ribbed slab and flat plate systems.", "This creates a slab-column connection situation (no beam-column joints) which is known to perform poorly under severe earthquake shaking unless well reinforced.", "Absence of seismic details throughout as seen on most photographs of damage.", "These include insufficient anchorage, development length, and continuity of slab reinforcement, and absence of integrity reinforcement.", "The orientation of the column section in several buildings is in one direction for all columns, rendering the weak-axis direction of the building, in the absence of shear walls, very vulnerable even to moderate shaking.", "These columns are often extremely thin in one direction.", "This can be observed in the columns at the right side of the building in Figure 4.30, the exterior columns in Figure 4.31, and all columns in the building in Figure 4.33.", "The use of heavy masonry infills either made of stone bricks or hollow concrete blocks.", "This practice results in high mass buildings which induce large seismic forces during ground shaking, becoming destructive in the absence of a seismic-resistant lateral system.", "Several partial and total collapses of commercial buildings were reported in T\u00fcrkiye.", "In Malatya, Hotel Avsar (a 10-story RC building) and Trend Garden Residence (an 8-story RC building) completely collapsed (Figures 4.37 and 4.38).", "According to Google Earth data, the buildings had been renovated during the past two years and appear new.", "However, Google Earth imagery shows that the buildings have existed at least since 2001.", "Therefore, these buildings are in the category of pre-2000 buildings in T\u00fcrkiye that were not designed according to the advances in the 1998 version of the TBSC.", "This can be one of the reasons for the observed collapse.", "Malatya was close to the end of the fault rupture in both the Mw 7.8 and Mw 7.5 earthquakes, impacted by forward directivity.", "The large displacement demands due to the forward directivity effects during these two events and the strong aftershocks in between likely contributed to the observed collapse.", "Some of the government buildings in T\u00fcrkiye experienced extensive damage and some collapsed.", "For instance, Figure 4.39 shows the collapse of a municipality building in Adiyaman, T\u00fcrkiye.", "Figure 4.40 shows the collapse of the first story and extensive damage to the second and third stories of a municipality building in Afsin, T\u00fcrkiye.", "It is likely that unreinforced masonry is more prevalent in rural areas than in cities.", "Despite damage

efforts are ongoing with difficulties in accessing rural areas.", "The immense rescue needs in the highly populated areas and the lack of access in reaching rural areas might explain the lack of visual evidence from these regions.", "With the available information, damage to a few masonry buildings is discussed in this section.", "Figure 4.41 shows the partial collapse of Ciftarslan House

years.", "According to Pak\u00f6z (2019), this house is a part-masonry and part-timber structure.", "The lower floor perimeter walls of the house were built of stone masonry, and the intermediate and upper floor walls were made of wooden frames filled with adobe material.", "After the earthquake sequence, no visible cracks were recognized in the house facade.", "However, part of its enclosure wall collapsed.", "This collapse might be due to an out of plane (OOP) bending mechanism of the very tall walls without transverse restraining elements.", "Turkish media has reported that 200 houses in Malatya province have been declared unusable.", "The rural area buildings were apparently built with adobe masonry walls and earth slabs supported by wooden beams, and experienced severe damage during

least 24 schools were destroyed and 83 were severely damaged (MEB 2023).", "Due to the time of occurrence of the earthquake, most of the schools were probably empty, which meant that the severe damage

located in Elbistan, Kahramanmara\u015f in Southern T\u00fcrkiye.", "From the image before the earthquake, the school was a regular building in plan and height.", "The post-earthquake image shows that the structure was an RC moment resisting frame in one direction and a shear wall system in the other direction.", "Although it is not clear from the images, a problem with this type of schools is the short columns due to partial height infill walls, which could have played a role in the observed collapse.", "In Antakya, Hatay province, a school building collapsed.", "Figure 4.44 shows this building with a lateral load resisting system composed of moment resisting frames with unreinforced masonry infill walls.", "In the pre-earthquake image, the building had a reduced footprint and open
