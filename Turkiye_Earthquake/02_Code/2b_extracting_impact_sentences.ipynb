telemetry.'],\n"," ['Comparison of the response spectra for both horizontal components of this ground motion against the DBE and MCE indicates that except for the short period region (T<0.1 s), the response spectra at this location clearly exceed the design levels.',\n","  'For structures with periods larger than 0.4 s, it exceeds the MCE levels as well.'],\n"," ['Even in cases when the seismic hazard is accurately characterized, the current design philosophy of ductility-based design, adopted in the current and earlier versions of the Turkish Building Seismic Code (TBSC) and the seismic regulations of similar codes and standards around the world (including capacity design, confinement, and adequate detailing), aims at ensuring collapse prevention due to brittle failures and ensuring large levels of ductile response at damaged locations before failure.',\n","  'Therefore, even code-compliant buildings could collapse when subjected to this intense motion.',\n","  'Furthermore, it is possible that seismic detailing required by the code might not have been followed in the actual construction.'],\n"," ['For earthquake-resistant buildings, some degree of damage is expected when they are subjected to the design earthquake intensity, and this damage is generally repairable.',\n","  'However, when the shaking level significantly exceeds the design levels, such seismic design details may not be adequate to prevent collapse.',\n","  'This may explain the collapse of several mid-rise buildings in Kahramanmaras.',\n","  'Finally, around 50% of the building stock in this area was constructed before 2000 and are more vulnerable under the experienced excessive levels of shaking.',\n","  'This explains the widespread destruction observed in this city.',\n","  'Another major factor that might have contributed to the collapse of some relatively newer structures that were supposed to be earthquake-resistant is the cascading hazard effect from the strong aftershocks, especially the second earthquake of Mw 7.6.',\n","  'Several mid-rise buildings that survived the main shock (per the design intent), collapsed during the Mw 7.6 earthquake.',\n","  'It is likely that damage and inelastic behavior caused by the Mw 7.7 earthquake weakened these buildings.',\n","  'Strong aftershocks and the second major event within a few hours of the mainshock imposed large demands on the already âplasticâ structures with significant strength and stiffness degradation.'],\n"," ['As mentioned above, the discussion on the possible reasons for the extensive destruction seems to be valid for buildings in this location as well.'],\n"," ['The peak spectral acceleration reached 2.9g at a period of 0.85 s at Hassa station (N-S direction).',\n","  'As discussed above, spectral accelerations are significantly larger than DBE and even MCE levels for roughly the full range of possible natural periods of buildings in the region.'],\n"," ['Particularly, it has been shown that spectral velocities (or their approximate values referred to as spectral pseudovelocities) are related to strain energy and maximum stresses, providing an effective measure of the potential damage and destructiveness of a ground motion (Villaverde 2009).',\n","  'The strong motion duration D5-95 at this station are 25.91 s (E-W) and 20.15 s (N-S) [ The Vs30 at TK.4612 (GÃ¶ksun seismometer location) indicates soft soil which has a tendency of higher shaking at longer periods.'],\n"," ['In the N-S direction, the spectral accelerations exceed 1g for periods of 1.00 to 2.00 s with the potential of causing heavy damage in high-rise buildings (10 stories and higher).',\n","  'This aligns with reports that âthe downtown district with taller buildings was hit particularly hard, while residential areas outside the city center had less apparent destructionâ (Abraham et al.2023).',\n","  'As a result, tall buildings at this location that would have been engineered to prevent collapse at MCE levels could experience heavy damage or collapse in this earthquake given that the shaking exceeded the MCE levels by a factor of 2 to 3 for certain periods.'],\n"," ['The impact of the earthquake sequence on buildings is clearly location dependent.',\n","  'For the same earthquake, the observed response spectra at station TK.4406 in AkÃ§adaÄ (Figure 2.27) do not exceed the MCE levels at any value of natural period.'],\n"," ['As a result, engineered buildings at this location may be able to withstand this shaking without collapse, albeit while sustaining moderate to heavy damage.',\n","  'As discussed above, high shaking levels as shown by the response spectra, structural system degradation during long duration of shaking from the two main events and aftershocks, and the occurrence of the earthquake sequence with strong multiple aftershocks, should all be considered altogether.'],\n"," ['Structural design: TBSC sets specific design requirements for different building types and structures, e.g., use of seismic-resistant materials, provision of adequate reinforcement, and improvement of seismic-resistant detailing, to ensure ductile behavior of RC buildings.',\n","  'Foundation design: TBSC sets requirements for the design of foundations, including the use of deep foundations, pile foundations, or raft foundations, to ensure that they can resist the forces generated during an earthquake.'],\n"," ['The lessons learned from the 1999 Kocaeli and Duzce earthquakes led to a post-1999 active period for the implementation of earthquake engineering principles in the whole country.',\n","  'Besides code development, utmost priority was placed on the transformation of old and vulnerable building inventory.'],\n"," ['The use of ready mixed concrete and deformed reinforcement bars became more widespread.',\n","  'Based on these developments, the buildings constructed after 2000 are assumed to have enhanced quality and considered to be less vulnerable to earthquake events.'],\n"," ['Table 3.1 shows the data for buildings in cities most affected by the 2023 earthquake sequence.'],\n"," ['Building data from TÃIK and field studies in Gaziantep city, where the first earthquake hit, reveal that almost two-thirds of the residential buildings are masonry and one-third are Reinforced Concrete (RC).',\n","  'The Kocaeli and Duzce earthquakes in 1999, which resulted in significant building damage and collapses, led to major changes in the seismic design practices, which were enacted in the 2007 version of the TBSC.'],\n"," ['However, there is evidence that even post-2000 and post-2007, RC and masonry buildings were not properly designed and detailed for adequate ductility and seismic resistance.',\n","  'The observations from the recent Mw 6.1 Duzce Earthquake on November 23, 2022, showed the importance of taking action to reduce the number of buildings with seismic deficiencies.'],\n"," ['The majority of the buildings in the Duzce region affected by the November 23, 2022 earthquake were new and constructed following the lessons learned from the 1999 Kocaeli earthquake.'],\n"," ['Effectively, they replaced the older buildings that were designed and constructed before 1999.',\n","  'The low level of damage observed during the 2022 Duzce earthquake demonstrated the effectiveness of code-specified seismic design requirements on the newer buildings with four or less stories and is a testimony to the effectiveness of the retrofit measures taken since 1999 (Sezen et al.2023).',\n","  'According to the observations from previous earthquakes, insufficient engineering design and construction quality are major contributing reasons for the failure of buildings in TÃ¼rkiye during recent earthquakes.',\n","  'These deficiencies are manifest in many undesirable structural flaws, such as weak column-strong beam, soft-story, non-ductile detailing of structural members and connections, lack of strength of lateral load carrying systems, and discontinuous frames.',\n","  'Moreover, removal of the load carrying system members, insufficient geotechnical site investigations, and poor foundation design can be added to the reasons for the observed damage of structural systems.',\n","  'This code included the first basic seismic design provisions.'],\n"," ['The second version of the Base Code published in 1995 planned for three appendices to separate and improve the seismic provisions.',\n","  'These are: Appendix 1 published in 1996 âConditions and Precautions for the Design and Construction of Earthquake-Resistant Buildingsâ, Appendix 2 published in 1997 âSeismic Assessment of Existing Buildingsâ, and Appendix 3 published in 2000 âStrengthening of Existing Buildings for Seismic Resistanceâ.'],\n"," ['Thus, it is reasonable to assume that any building constructed prior to 2000 lacks seismic details and can be considered non-ductile.',\n","  'However, two more local categories are added: 1) local intermediate moment frames (constructed with relative ease in Syria) and 2) local special moment frames (constructed with more difficulty in Syria).',\n","  'Moreover, Appendix 2 required shear walls for critical buildings like hospitals, public buildings, and high-rise buildings.',\n","  'It is noteworthy that the seismic design/provisions in the Syrian Code were considered optional to adopt until 2008 and that the unreinforced non-ductile bearing wall systems made of masonry and concrete are permitted by the Syrian Code in low-rise buildings up to six stories.'],\n"," ['Figure 3.2 shows an example of common flawed practices in non-engineered buildings promoted through a local âReconciliation Lawâ, which allowed building owners to register the building with little or no structural review or building inspection/assessment.',\n","  'Furthermore, permits were granted to recently registered buildings of less than 6 stories to allow construction of additional stories (up to 6) despite being non-engineered buildings with unknown column and foundation capacity.',\n","  'Those additional floors were built completely from hollow concrete block bearing walls, and solid slabs that are 60 to 80 mm thick with no beams and insufficient reinforcing bars.',\n","  'Another example is related to earthquake-resistant designed public buildings and hospitals.'],\n"," ['In this case, as-built conditions were substantially different from the structural drawings.',\n","  'For instance, the local special moment frames were usually built with substandard quality, reinforcement quantity and details, such as using smaller diameter reinforcing bars or even removing the reinforcement totally from some members.',\n","  'Based on the inspection of damage photographs, information from Syrian engineers, the above code development history and construction practices analysis, and the post-war rebuilding practices in the earthquake affected regions, following preliminary observations can be made.',\n","  'It is reasonable to assume that most building stock in the earthquake affected areas is non-ductile concrete systems with masonry infill walls or unreinforced bearing masonry wall systems.',\n","  'The non-ductile concrete systems for multi-story low-rise and mid-rise buildings are either beam and slab gravity frames (may be designed for wind loads in some cases) or flat plates or ribbed/joisted slabs with hollow blocks with no or shallow spandrel beams.'],\n"," ['It is noteworthy that the ribbed slabs with no projected/drop beams and the flat plates, in the absence of seismic design and structural walls, are most vulnerable to severe damage and collapse even with moderate earthquake shaking.',\n","  'The multi-story low-rise and mid-rise non-ductile concrete systems in Northern Syria are evidently thin joist slabs with hollow blocks or flat plates, with no drop beams and no or very shallow spandrel beams that are slightly deeper than the slabs.',\n","  'Columns are apparently thin with extremely low reinforcement ratios, small diameter reinforcing bars and poor confinement (refer to Figure 3.3).'],\n"," ['These buildings appear to be non-engineered or poorly engineered at best with no shear walls, perhaps built post 2011 war.',\n","  'Concrete quality appears low from inspection of damaged photographs.',\n","  'For the low-rise buildings (1 to 2 stories) in these areas, unreinforced masonry seems more common.'],\n"," ['The buildings are older and the use of slab and beam non-ductile concrete frames with infill walls and the unreinforced bearing wall masonry system (both are considered the mainstream construction methods in pre-2011 era) seem to be more common.'],\n"," ['Moreover, no shear walls can be observed in any building type.',\n","  'In this section, typical building damage and collapses are documented, organized by occupancy for residential, commercial,

event indicates that failure of this column initiated total collapse of the building.'],\n"," ['RC frames with unreinforced masonry infill walls is a common structural topology in TÃ¼rkiye.',\n","  'In low levels of excitation, these infill walls add to the stiffness and strength of the structure, providing beneficial contributions.',\n","  'However, even in cases where the infill walls are uniformly distributed along the height of the structure and there are no initial soft or weak stories, brittle failure of the infill walls due to in-plane/out-of-plane interaction can lead to the formation of soft stories during an earthquake (GÃ¼nay and Mosalam 2015), leading to eventual collapse.'],\n"," ['Considering the two strong earthquakes (Mw 7.8 and Mw 7.5) and the aftershocks between

noted that the infill walls of the collapsed buildings discussed above were not isolated from the bounding frames, which is the main reason why the infill walls were an important factor in the formation of weak and soft stories.',\n","  'Although the current version of the TBSC includes provisions for the inclusion of the infill walls for identification of vertical irregularities and suggests methods for isolating the infill walls from the frames, such isolation and inclusion of infill walls in numerical models are not required.'],\n"," ['Revisions in the TBSC for explicit consideration of infill walls and their isolation from the frames should be revisited.',\n","  'In some of the collapsed buildings, it is possible that the presence of soft and weak stories is accompanied by other characteristics of low ductility response (e.g., inadequate seismic detailing such as lack of confinement at the beam- and column-ends and insufficient transverse reinforcement at beam-column joints).'],\n"," ['The particular issue with the detrimental effects of infill walls at large shaking is not specific to only TÃ¼rkiye.'],\n"," ['In addition to their effect on the stiffness of upper stories, masonry infill walls, both at the exterior and interior walls of each floor, add considerable mass to the building, resulting in larger inertial forces developed during ground shaking.',\n","  'Poor behavior of RC frame structures with masonry infill walls was observed in several previous earthquakes in the world as well (Braga et al.2011; Manfredi et al.2014;

Figure 4.13 might have collapsed due to the combined effect of soft and weak stories and accompanying torsional response.',\n","  'An important reason for the collapses in the earthquake sequence is that such buildings were subjected to two large magnitude earthquakes (Mw 7.8 and Mw 7.5) and major aftershocks in between.',\n","  'Figure 4.14 shows a severely damaged building after the first earthquake that continued to collapse hours later during an aftershock putting at risk the lives of first responders.'],\n"," ['The 1999 Kocaeli and Duzce earthquakes, which resulted in significant building damage and collapses, led to major changes in seismic design, which were further reflected in the 2007 version of the TBSC.',\n","  'Therefore, the buildings in the region can be categorized as pre-2000 (not up to date with modern seismic codes) and post-2000 (supposed to be designed according to the modern principles of seismic design).',\n","  'There is evidence that even post-2000 and post-2007 RC and masonry buildings collapsed.'],\n"," ['Regarding the last two reasons, when buildings are designed as seismically resistant, some degree of repairable damage is expected due to higher earthquake levels than what was considered in the design of these buildings.',\n","  'An RC residential building with shear walls, newly constructed in 2022, had a catastrophic collapse as shown in before and after images in Figure 4.15.',\n","  'Another new residential RC building with shear walls collapsed while it was under construction (Figure 4.16).'],\n"," ['In this figure, shear walls are oriented along one direction of the building.',\n","  'Extensive concrete crushing is visible at the shear wall base, denoting sliding-shear failure, as well as diagonal concrete crushing (e.g., refer to the third wall after the corner column), suggesting a combined flexure-shear diagonal failure.',\n","  'Furthermore, an axial failure of a corner beam-column joint is visible, with a possible under-design or shortage of sufficient confinement.',\n","  'Significant beam yielding along the orthogonal direction to the building lateral collapse in the shear wall direction might have led to shear and axial failure of the joint.'],\n"," ['Another building that has collapsed on its side is shown in Figure 4.17.',\n","  'There are several potential reasons for this failure: (1) Inadequate foundation, or (2) Initiation of the collapse of the structure from one side, resulting in the toppling of the structure.',\n","  'It is noted that this type of collapse due to the second reason is known as sidesway collapse, which occurs due to lateral dynamic instability at large lateral displacements, when the lateral strength of the structure degrades significantly.',\n","  'This type of collapse is different from the ones discussed in earlier images, where the RC buildings mostly collapsed by losing gravity load carrying capacity, much before reaching these excessive lateral displacements.'],\n"," ['The sidesway collapse might have occurred in buildings with larger displacement capacities, which have been exceeded by the large demands in this earthquake sequence, while the gravity collapse occurred in buildings with less deformation capacity (ductility) due to presence of vertical irregularities, insufficient confinement, weak-column/strong-beam proportions, or other characteristics of nonductile concrete buildings.',\n","  'In addition to the numerous failures shown above, Figure 4.19 (b) and (c) show that half of a 15- story mixed-use concrete building collapsed by separation from the other half.',\n","  'This collapse was reported to occur after a Mw 6.1 aftershock.'],\n"," ['From the top view of the building, an excessive reentrant corner can be seen in the middle.'],\n"," ['This reentrant corner could have led to excessive stress concentrations at that portion of the building (FEMA-P154, 2012).',\n","  'This may have caused the splitting of one half of the building from the other contributing to the collapse of the split half.',\n","  'It is also noted that the same reentrant corner is present in similar buildings in the neighborhood that are standing, hinting at possible other structural issues of this collapsed building.'],\n"," ['Another partially collapsed building is shown in Figure 4.20.',\n","  'It is possible that the failure in the corner of this building took place due to a combined effect of the two horizontal components of the ground motions at the location of the building.',\n","  'Increased shear forces due to plan torsion irregularity could have contributed to the occurrence of such failure.',\n","  'As discussed in Section 3, it is likely that most building stock in the earthquake impacted regions in Syria is non-engineered, poorly engineered, or at best gravity-designed non-ductile systems.'],\n"," ['The heaviest damage and the most collapses occurred in 4 cities in Syria (Aleppo, Latakia, Idlib,

the highlighted blue rectangle.',\n","  'It is evident from the partial collapse photographs that some older buildings in Syria were constructed with no gap to neighboring buildings of the same height, perhaps using the neighboring building as formwork for concrete elements (Figures 4.22, 4.23 and 4.27), which may have helped avoiding total collapse or preventing collapse in some instances.'],\n"," ['The diaphragm (floor slab) failure was commonly observed in many buildings (Figures 4.27 to 4.29, 4.32 and 4.33) when the horizontal diaphragm is unable to resist lateral forces

to columns are evident in these figures.',\n","  'Very vulnerable slab-column connection conditions resulted from the absence of beams along with poor anchorage to columns, and in many instances, it
