Storm-related death toll from Hurricane Ian was 125 as of November 10, 2022. Death toll included 119 storm-related fatalities in Florida, five in North Carolina, and one in Virginia. Risk modelers estimated wind and coastal storm surge losses of $40-$74 billion. The majority of the deaths (57) were reported in Lee County, FL, and an estimated 60% were caused by drowning. The strong hurricane winds associated with Hurricane Ian caused widespread power outages in Florida. North Carolina had power outage of more than 358,000 (Dean, K. Cataudella, K., 2022) The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) reported that cell service outages dropped from 65.0% to around 5.0%. The total number of wireline/cable users affected in Florida dropped from around 320,000 users to around 110,000. 642 patients evacuated from 6 health care facilities in Charlotte, Lee, Sarasota, Orange, and Volusia Counties. Hospitals in the impacted area suffered severe staffing shortages due to displaced workers (FHA, 2022) Telecommunications infrastructure primarily in southwest Florida was not functional following the storm due to loss of power, flooded generators, and in at least one case, the collapse of a cellular tower. The coastal roads to port facilities and the access bridges were severely damaged. Isolated damage to power infrastructure caused several days of outages for several days, notably downed power lines. The damage to agriculture was much larger, particularly for the citrus industry, due to wind damage to crops and the flooded access bridges of Sanibel Island. As such, Hurricane Ian will likely be one of the costliest landfalling hurricanes of all time in the US, claiming over 100 lives. It took almost nine days to restore power in Lee, Charlotte, and De Soto counties in Florida; as of October 3, 2022, Florida had more than 80% of consumers without power.
