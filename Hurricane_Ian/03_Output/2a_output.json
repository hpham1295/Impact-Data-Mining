severe coastal erosion near the causeways and roads that led to scour and partial damage (e.g., differential settlements) or washout of pavements and causeways, and the damage to approach slabs, as shown in Figure 5.3.", "As Hurricane Ian moved towards the northwest, causing intense precipitation with long durations, inland transportation networks of central and northwest Florida were disrupted

locations experienced scour of roads and culverts (Wicks, 2022).", "Despite the extensive damage to several bridges and roadways in coastal and inland areas, the Florida Department of Transportation

three different types of damage at different locations (see Fig.CS.5.3).", "The Sanibel Causeway consists of three bridges (A, B, C) and two islands (Causeway Island Park A, B) as shown in Fig.CS.5.3.", "Interestingly, in contrast to past hurricanes (e.g.Hurricane Katrina) that had uplifted bridge superstructures in multiple locations of the Gulf Coast Region, in this case the superstructures and their connections to the substructure (piers) were intact and the damage occurred at the approach slab of both Bridge A (on the mainland side) and Bridge B (on the south side).", "In both cases the approach slab was elevated (same elevation with the bridge span) and was supported on backfill material that was protected by wing-walls consisting of modular panels restrained by soil anchors embedded in the compacted fill.", "These panels were exposed to lateral loads from the surge and the waves.", "Since there is no observed erosion of the area in the vicinity of the wing-walls, it could be hypothesized that the lateral hydrodynamic loads made some of the panels unstable, which exposed the backfill material to hydrodynamic actions and scour.", "Once the backfill material started undergoing scour, the vertical pressures that were applied by the backfill on the slab and helped keep the slab in place were reduced, essentially leading to a simply supported slab.", "Two other types of damage were also observed in the Sanibel Causeway, particularly \u2018at the two islands.", "The first type was the partial damage of the pavements on the seaward side, which was caused by the erosion of the soil below the roads, and the second type was the total washout of the road with the island below it (see Fig.CS.5.3).", "Interestingly, for both island A and B, the first type of damage occurred towards the north side of the island and the second type (total washout) occurred towards the south end.", "As shown in Figure CS.5.4, for island A at the location where a total washout was observed, the road was very close to the shore, which means that it could be exposed to surge and direct impact from the waves.", "On the other hand, at the location with partial damage and scour of the pavement, the road was located further from the shore.", "This would consequently imply that while in the former case the road would be subjected to hydrodynamic effects (e.g., scour) immediately after the instant at which the surge and waves reached the elevation of the road, in the latter case the road would be subjected to the same effects only after the sandy beach (on the seaward side) would have been eroded.", "Apart from this hypothetical explanation, other potential reasons that could have contributed to the different levels of damage are (i) differences in road elevations, (ii) directionality effects which may be important in the case of skewed bridge superstructures subjected to extreme", "Hurricane Ian caused damages to the telecommunication systems of Florida and South Carolina.", "The west coast of Florida and the Ft.
