event an outlier among recent hurricane impacts of the past two decades.',\n","    'Acapulco witnessed an unprecedented scale of damage to single- and multi-story buildings.',\n","    'In low-lying regions of Acapulco, high winds dominated the structural responses, inducing failures to multiple glazing, cladding, and roof surfaces.',\n","    'These failures extended to nearly every high-rise structure in the nearshore region.',\n","    'On the other hand, low-rise structures experienced significant roof damage as well as flooding caused by rainwater.',\n","    'In elevated regions of Acapulco, rainwater caused mudslides and foundation failures in single-story structures.',\n","    'Acapulco witnessed severe damage to residential structures.',\n","    'Aerial photographs of the residential area in Coyuca de Benitez (located approximately 16 miles northwest of Acapulco) revealed extensive damage to roofs, walls, foundations, and various structural and architectural features (Fig.4.1).',\n","    'The impact of blown-off roofs and walls led to widespread flooding inside houses due to water infiltration.',\n","    'The damage was associated with high wind loads on roofs and walls, floodwaters, and wind-borne debris.',\n","    'The extent of the damage to single-family residential homes in Acapulco is lacking at this point due to limited media coverage.',\n","    'Based on limited satellite imagery and a few social media posts, damage appears to be widespread but dependent on the structure type, with lower-income housing with wood framing and corrugated panels suffering widespread damage.',\n","    'There was unprecedented damage to the building envelopes (e.g., glazing and cladding) of many structures due to the wind loads, though the lateral force-resisting structural systems appeared to perform adequately.',\n","    'Some window failures would be expected due to wind-borne debris, but generally limited to the lower levels of the buildings.',\n","    'However, in this case, many buildings experienced total exterior glazing loss over the full height of the building.',\n","    'Many buildings now display damaged roofs, loss of glazing, and failure of exterior wall cladding as a result.',\n","    'Examples of modern high-rise residential buildings such as the recently completed Mare Acapulco Diamante (Fig.4.2), and the Diamante condominiums (Fig.4.3) show extensive loss of glazing over the entire exterior of the buildings.',\n","    'Despite the significant age gap, all displayed extensive levels of damage to multiple floors.',\n","    'Figure 4.4 shows three screenshots from a video of the damage caused to the Solar Ocean building.',\n","    'The first image shows a view from the unprotected balcony

aftermath of Hurricane Otis (Fig.4.6).',\n","    'The shopping mall encompasses commercial and shopping stores that experienced substantial damage to its roof, curtain walls, and glass cladding

GNP Seguros (Fig.4.8) suffered severe wind damage.',\n","    'Reports of road washouts were common in the more mountainous regions surrounding Acapulco, e.g., in the municipality of Kilmetro 42, Guerrero, Mexico, part of a road washed away (Fig.5.1).',\n","    'Although the road signs and power poles were severely damaged, the “stand-alone” untethered tower in the background appears to be intact.',\n","    'The trees on the right-hand side of the photo appear to be debarked.',\n","    'Neither of these facilities appears to have suffered any structural damage during the hurricane.',\n","    'While high winds dominated glazing and cladding failures in nearshore regions of Acapulco, rainwater and flooding caused significant geotechnical damage in elevated regions.',\n","    'At the road level, floodwaters caused mudslides that resulted in partial or full collapse of road lanes.',\n","    'Figure 6.2 presents a case where the edge of the road collapsed due to slope failure.',\n","    'Furthermore, residential structures located uphill around Acapulco were severely affected by soil failures caused by moving floodwaters.',\n","    'A number of these structures appear to rely on inadequate foundation support.',\n","    'As an example, Figure 6.3 shows a slope failure that resulted in the foundation collapse of a one-story residential structure.',\n","    'This section aims to provide some insights into how Hurricane Otis affected manmade (levees, seawalls, jetties, etc.)',\n","    'No significant damages have been reported in any of the hard coastal infrastructure (seawalls, port platforms, etc.)',\n","]\n","s_para_comm = [\n","    'Over half a million electricity consumers were affected.',\n","    'Meanwhile, roads, ports and air transit were disrupted, limiting egressing and access to the affected coastal city.',\n","    'The hurricane led to a reported 45 casualties and an estimated $15 billion in damage.',\n","    'One of the hardest-hit areas was the popular beach resort city of Acapulco, located on the Pacific coast of Mexico in the state of Guerrero.',\n","    \"The hurricane also took a toll on the region's essential services and infrastructure.\",\n","    \"The electric grid was severely affected, leaving 513,544 customers in the State of Guerrero without power in the aftermath of the hurricane's landfall.\",\n","    \"While efforts to restore power made progress, as of October 31, Mexico's Federal Electricity Commission reported that only 75% of the affected areas had their electricity service reinstated (CFE, 2023a).\",\n","    \"The hurricane's impact extended to communication networks as well, with phone lines and cellular phone service in the region being disrupted for a significant period, complicating emergency response and coordination.\",\n","    'About 120 hospitals and 33 schools in the region were reported as damaged due to the hurricane event.',\n","    'As a result of these and other related factors, the Ministry of Education of Guerrero (SEG) decided to temporarily suspend academic activities in Acapulco and Coyuca de Benitez from October 30 to November 3 (Reliefweb, 2023).',\n","    'Furthermore, road closures and the inability to access the airport due to landslides created additional challenges, causing delays in planned government and military interventions in the affected areas.',\n","    \"Acapulco's ports were forced to close during the hurricane, disrupting not only local trade and transportation but also the city's economic activities, which rely heavily on tourism.\",\n","    'Reports emerged of a shortage of food and drinking water following the hurricane, primarily due to the late arrival of aid and insufficient supplies.',\n","    'Many grocery stores remained closed, severely limiting access to essential food items and leaving residents in a precarious position (Mega et al., 2023).',\n","    \"The financial implications of the hurricane's devastation are substantial.\",\n","    'According to Enki Research, the cost of Hurricane Otis could potentially reach as high as $15 billion, underlining the extensive damage and disruption caused by this hurricane (Romero and Ore, 2023).',\n","    'Additionally, one of the most salient impacts of the hurricane has been the widespread displacement of families.',\n","    'It was estimated that approximately 250,000 families have been left homeless because of Hurricane Otis, according to Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (Rivera, 2023).',\n","    'High winds and flooding pose a significant risk to the impacted community.',\n","    'Tragically, preparedness, early warnings, and effective evacuations, which could have helped minimize the casualties, were all absent during this event.',\n","    'The government suspended electricity payments from November 2023 to February 2024 and called for the delivery of basic foods to the estimated 250,000 families impacted by the event.',\n","    'Hurricane Otis, unfortunately, followed this pattern, resulting in a significant human toll.',\n","    'According to the Governor of Guerrero state, 45 people died and 47 are missing as of October 31 (Cohen, 2023).',\n","    'Notably main roads connecting Acapulco to the interior of Mexico, e.g., Mexico City, were blocked by debris and landslides; the port was
