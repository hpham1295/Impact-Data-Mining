It involves refining the text by removing or cleaning elements such as URLs, footnotes, and titles of figures & tables. Users can directly utilize this notebook following the 0_input.ipynb if they wish to include all sections of the document in their analysis. However, if users wish to exclude certain sections from their analysis, they should first utilize the 1a_preprocessing notebook to identify and select these sections. Following this, they need to update the drop_headings variable in 0_input.ipynb with the sections they have chosen to omit and run the file again.

buildings.',\n"," 'However, several collapses of buildings constructed after 2000 were also observed.',\n"," 'There are several reasons for the collapse of these relatively newer buildings, including: (a) ground motions exceeding MCE levels, (b) impact of a sequence of large ground motions with compounding effects, (c) possibility of buildings not designed according to seismic code provisions, and (d) possibility of construction that did not comply with the design and specifications in the structural drawings.',\n"," 'Compared to the response of buildings, other infrastructure performance was generally acceptable, with most of the bridges, roads and tunnels remaining operational, and no major issues with the power grid and water supply infrastructure.',\n"," 'In terms of good performance, the 12 seismically isolated hospitals in the earthquake-impacted region were operational after the earthquakes, and more importantly, allowed these healthcare facilities to serve their emergency

38.089°N 37.239°E that struck near the city of Elbistan, also in the Kahramanmaraş province (AFAD 2023b).',\n"," 'These small differences with respect to the epicenters’ coordinates and earthquake magnitudes reported by USGS are common, as they are based on considerations of different recording stations and different algorithms for determining the focus and magnitude of seismic events.',\n"," 'The earthquake sequence resulted in a very large number of fatalities and injuries.',\n"," 'As of March 9, 2023, the total death toll was reported to be 45,968 people in Türkiye and around 6,000 in

earthquakes, Iskenderun State Hospital, the main training, and research hospital in the city of Iskenderun, stopped functioning due to a partial collapse.',\n"," 'On February 7, the Ministry of Health reported that injured people from Iskenderun were transferred to Mersin City Hospital in ambulances and by the Iskenderun ship of the Ministry of National Defense.',\n"," 'Ninety-eight wounded patients were transferred the day of the earthquake.',\n"," 'As of February 7, Mersin City Hospital was assisting 590 injured, with 170 in intensive care units.',\n"," 'In general, patients from the affected province of Hatay were transferred to Adana City Hospital and other hospitals in the region.',\n"," 'As of February 7, the Adana City Hospital was treating 600 injured patients, including 220 in intensive care units.',\n"," 'Furthermore, critically injured patients were transferred by plane to city hospitals in Ankara and Istanbul (Ministry of Health 2023).',\n"," 'For the Mw 7.8

second event than if they were subjected solely to the second event.',\n"," 'Extreme Event Solutions at Verisk predicted that the economic losses and industry-insured losses due to the earthquake sequence in Türkiye will likely exceed $20 billion (USD) and $1 billion (USD), respectively (Verisk 2023).',\n"," 'Damage to personal property is expected to be significant, particularly given the number of complete collapses that result in not only significant threats to life safety, but also total loss of contents (Figure 1.5).',\n"," 'Unfortunately, insured losses may be only around $1 billion (USD) due to low insurance coverage in the affected regions (Fitch 2023).',\n"," 'The Turkish Catastrophe Insurance Pool (TCIP) was created after the 1999 Izmit earthquake to cover damage to residential buildings, but it does not cover human loss, liability claims, or business interruptions.',\n"," 'Iskenderun is home to heavy industries, e.g., steel production, and two major container

2023a).',\n"," 'The fire began at 1400 GMT on February 6 and was eventually extinguished via military helicopters and planes two days later.',\n"," 'Reportedly, hundreds of shipping containers were ablaze.',\n"," 'A leading global container shipping group, AP Moller Maersk, said that there had been significant damage to logistics and transport infrastructure specifically around the Port of Iskenderun, requiring that company and other shipping lines to divert containers to nearby ports and hubs.',\n"," 'The earthquakes also caused damage to gas transmission lines and disrupted the energy supply.',\n"," 'In particular, gas supply was halted in Kahramanmaraş, Gaziantep, and Hatay provinces and some other districts.',\n"," 'In terms of economic loss, the ramifications could include the spoiling of food items requiring refrigeration (Daily Sabah 2023), but also disruptions to key industries.',\n"," 'For example, the earthquake sequence has affected several provinces in the country’s southeast, which is home to around 30% of Türkiye’s steel-producing Electric-Arc Furnace (EAF) capacity, equivalent to approximately 11.7 million tons per year of steel production.',\n"," 'Iskenderun is an important port in Türkiye for steel imports and exports, as well as for raw material, mostly steel scrap.',\n"," 'Thus the port’s closure, as well as disruptions in power and gas supply, caused steel production to be disrupted.',\n"," 'Roughly 80% of these mills are long steel producers (wire, rod, rail, bars, structural sections), which could lead to shortages of a commodity vital for reconstruction.',\n"," 'In Southern Türkiye, members of commerce chambers, exchanges, and industrial zones have opted to halt their production to provide aid to survivors.',\n"," 'Members of the Turkish business sector have promised to dispatch hundreds of trucks loaded with supplies and equipment including cranes and excavators.',\n"," 'Diyarbakır Commerce and Industry Chamber Chair Mehmet

implementation in Syria due to several economic, societal, and political reasons.',\n"," 'Figure 3.2 shows an example of common flawed practices in non-engineered buildings promoted through a local “Reconciliation Law”, which allowed building owners to register the building with little or no structural review or building inspection/assessment.',\n"," 'Furthermore, permits were granted to recently registered buildings of less than 6 stories to allow construction of additional stories (up to 6) despite being non-engineered buildings with unknown column and foundation capacity.',\n"," 'Those additional floors were built completely from hollow concrete block bearing walls, and solid slabs that are 60 to 80 mm thick with no beams and insufficient reinforcing bars.',\n"," 'Another example is related to earthquake-resistant designed public buildings and hospitals.',\n"," 'In this case, as-built conditions were substantially different from the structural drawings.',\n"," 'For

analysis, and the post-war rebuilding practices in the earthquake affected regions, following preliminary observations can be made.',\n"," 'It is reasonable to assume that most building stock in the earthquake affected areas is non-ductile concrete systems with masonry infill walls or unreinforced bearing masonry wall systems.',\n"," 'The non-ductile concrete systems for multi-story low-rise and mid-rise buildings are either beam and slab gravity frames (may be designed for wind loads in some cases) or flat plates or ribbed/joisted slabs with hollow blocks with no or shallow spandrel beams.',\n"," 'It is noteworthy that the ribbed slabs with no projected/drop beams and the flat plates, in the absence of seismic design and structural walls, are most vulnerable to severe damage and collapse even with moderate earthquake shaking.',\n"," 'The multi-story low-rise and mid-rise non-ductile concrete systems in Northern Syria are evidently thin joist slabs with hollow blocks or flat

distribution of infill walls around the perimeter could have increased the torsional response during ground shaking.',\n"," 'The 7-story mixed use RC building in Figure 4.9 likely collapsed due to similar reasons as indicated for the collapse of the 6-story mixed use building in Figure 4.8.',\n"," 'It is located on a street corner with shopfront openings on both streets, and presumably solid fire walls on the back sides of the building.',\n"," 'The torsional effects during ground shaking would impose large shear and bending demands on the front corner column (yellow color in Figure 4.9a).',\n"," 'The video of this event indicates that failure of this column initiated total collapse of the building.',\n"," 'Other examples of collapses due to potential weak/soft stories are provided in Figures 4.10 and 4.11.',\n"," 'RC frames with unreinforced masonry infill walls is a common structural topology in Türkiye.',\n"," 'In low levels of excitation, these infill walls add to the stiffness and strength of the structure, providing beneficial contributions.',\n"," 'However, even in cases where the infill walls are uniformly distributed along the height of the structure and there are no initial soft or weak stories, brittle failure of the infill walls due to in-plane/out-of-plane interaction can lead to the formation of soft stories during an earthquake (Günay and Mosalam 2015), leading to eventual collapse.',\n"," 'Considering the two strong earthquakes (Mw 7.8 and Mw 7.5) and the aftershocks between them, the formation of soft stories due to infill walls in the first event could have led to the collapse of these structures during the second event, as shown in Figures 4.4 to 4.10.',\n"," 'It is noted that the infill walls of the collapsed buildings discussed above were not isolated from the bounding frames, which is the main reason why the infill walls were an important factor in the formation of weak and soft stories.',\n"," 'Although the current version of the TBSC includes provisions for the inclusion of the infill walls for identification of vertical irregularities and suggests methods for isolating the infill walls from the frames, such isolation and inclusion of infill walls in numerical models are not required.',\n"," 'Revisions in the TBSC for explicit consideration of infill walls and their isolation from the frames should be revisited.',\n"," 'In some of the collapsed buildings, it is possible that the presence of soft and weak stories is accompanied by other characteristics of low ductility response (e.g., inadequate seismic detailing such as lack of confinement at the beam- and column-ends and insufficient transverse reinforcement at beam-column joints).',\n"," 'The particular issue with the detrimental effects of infill walls at large shaking is not specific to only Türkiye.',\n"," 'In addition to their effect on the stiffness of upper stories, masonry infill walls, both at the exterior and interior walls of each floor, add considerable mass to the building, resulting in larger inertial forces developed during ground shaking.',\n"," 'Poor behavior of RC frame structures with masonry infill walls was observed in several previous earthquakes in the world as well (Braga et al.2011; Manfredi et al.2014; Marinković et al.2022).',\n"," 'The 7-story building on a 2-story podium in Figure 4.12 is a mixed-use building, where the podium is used as a commercial space and the 7-story building has residential units.',\n"," 'The first story of the podium structure has glass façades and is weaker and softer than the second story of the podium.',\n"," 'This is a potential reason for the collapse of this building.',\n"," 'As observed from the right figure, all stories of the 7-story building collapsed, likely due to the impact of the podium collapse.',\n"," 'The 2-story buildings in Figure 4.13 might have collapsed due to the combined effect of soft and weak stories and accompanying torsional response.',\n"," 'An important reason for the collapses in the earthquake sequence is that such buildings were subjected to two large magnitude earthquakes (Mw 7.8 and Mw 7.5) and major aftershocks in between.',\n"," 'Figure 4.14 shows a severely damaged building after the first earthquake that continued to collapse hours later during an aftershock putting at risk the lives of first responders.',\n"," 'Modern principles of earthquake design were implemented in the TBSC, starting with the 1998 version of the code.',\n"," 'The 1999 Kocaeli and Duzce earthquakes, which resulted in significant building damage and collapses, led to major changes in seismic design, which were further reflected in the 2007 version of the TBSC.',\n"," 'Therefore, the buildings in the region can be categorized as pre-2000 (not up to date with modern seismic codes) and post-2000 (supposed to be designed according to the modern principles of seismic design).',\n"," 'There is evidence that even post-2000 and post-2007 RC and masonry buildings collapsed.',\n"," 'As noted earlier, there are several reasons for these collapses, including: (a) the ground motions exceeding MCE levels, (b) several large motions experienced by the buildings back-to-back in a sequence, (c) possibility of buildings not designed according to the code, and (d) possibility of the construction and material quality not following the intended design.',\n"," 'Regarding the last two reasons, when buildings are designed as seismically resistant, some degree of repairable damage is expected due to higher earthquake levels than what was considered in the design of these buildings.',\n"," 'However, when the shaking level significantly exceeds the design levels as the case here in this earthquake sequence, details of construction become a major factor to distinguish between collapse and other levels of damage.',\n"," 'An RC residential building with shear walls, newly constructed in 2022, had a catastrophic collapse as shown in before and after images in Figure 4.15.',\n"," 'Another new residential RC building with shear walls collapsed while it was under construction (Figure 4.16).',\n"," 'In this figure, shear walls are oriented along one direction of the building.',\n"," 'Extensive concrete crushing is visible at the shear wall base, denoting sliding-shear failure, as well as diagonal concrete crushing (e.g., refer to the third wall after the corner column), suggesting a combined flexure-shear diagonal failure.',\n"," 'Furthermore, an axial failure of a corner beam-column joint is visible, with a possible under-design or shortage of sufficient confinement.',\n"," 'Significant beam yielding along the orthogonal direction to the building lateral collapse in the shear wall direction might have led to shear and axial failure of the joint.',\n"," 'Another building that has collapsed on its side is shown in Figure 4.17.',\n"," 'There are several potential reasons for this failure: (1) Inadequate foundation, or (2) Initiation of the collapse of the structure from one side, resulting in the toppling of the structure.',\n"," 'It is noted that this type of collapse due to the second reason is known as sidesway collapse, which occurs due to lateral dynamic instability at large lateral displacements, when the lateral strength of the structure degrades significantly.',\n"," 'This type of collapse is different from the ones discussed in earlier images, where the RC buildings mostly collapsed by losing gravity load carrying capacity, much before reaching these excessive lateral displacements.',\n"," 'This difference is conceptually demonstrated in Figure 4.18.',\n"," 'The sidesway collapse might have occurred in buildings with larger displacement capacities, which have been exceeded by the large demands in this earthquake sequence, while the gravity collapse occurred in buildings with less deformation capacity (ductility) due to presence of vertical irregularities, insufficient confinement, weak-column/strong-beam proportions, or other characteristics of nonductile concrete buildings.',\n"," 'In addition to the numerous failures shown above, Figure 4.19 (b) and (c) show that half of a 15- story mixed-use concrete building collapsed by separation from the other half.',\n"," 'This collapse was reported to occur after a Mw 6.1 aftershock.',\n"," 'From the top view of the building, an excessive reentrant corner can be seen in the middle.',\n"," 'This reentrant corner could have led to excessive stress concentrations at that portion of the building (FEMA-P154, 2012).',\n"," 'This may have caused the splitting of one half of the building from the other contributing to the collapse of the split half.',\n"," 'It is also noted that the same reentrant corner is present in similar buildings in the neighborhood that are standing, hinting at possible other structural issues of this collapsed building.',\n"," 'Another partially collapsed building is shown in Figure 4.20.',\n"," 'It is possible that the failure in the corner of this building took place due to a combined effect of the two horizontal components of the ground motions at the location of the building.',\n"," 'Increased shear forces due to plan torsion irregularity could have contributed to the occurrence of such failure.',\n"," 'As discussed in Section 3, it is likely that most building stock in the earthquake impacted regions in Syria is non-engineered, poorly engineered, or at best gravity-designed non-ductile systems.',\n"," 'The heaviest damage and the most collapses occurred in 4 cities in Syria (Aleppo, Latakia, Idlib, and Hama) and in 40 towns and villages in Northern Syria (Idlib) and its countryside (Reef Idlib), Aleppo and its

correlation.',\n"," 'In some cases, a non-ductile concrete system is mixed with an unreinforced masonry bearing wall system within the same building, especially for the purpose of adding more floors to an existing building (refer to the building in the red rectangle in Figure 4.26).',\n"," 'Severe damage before complete collapse due to low-quality materials made it sometimes difficult to distinguish from the debris a skeleton RC structure from a bearing wall system.',\n"," 'For instance, while the rubble in Figure 4.26 may suggest all masonry construction, evidence of a few RC columns can still be detected as in the highlighted blue rectangle.',\n"," 'It is evident from the partial collapse photographs that some older buildings in Syria were constructed with no gap to neighboring

failure.',\n"," 'The absence of slab integrity reinforcement, lack of continuity reinforcement, and poor anchorage to columns are evident in these figures.',\n"," 'Very vulnerable slab-column
