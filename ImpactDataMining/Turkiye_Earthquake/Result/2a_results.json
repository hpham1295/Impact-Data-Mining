T\u00fcrkiye were constructed before 2000, i.e., before modern principles of earthquake design were implemented in the Turkish Seismic Code.", "Fragility functions developed for the building stock in the area showed that collapse under large shaking was possible for these relatively older buildings.", "However, several collapses of buildings constructed after 2000 were also observed.", "There are several reasons for the collapse of these relatively newer buildings, including: (a) ground motions exceeding MCE levels, (b) impact of a sequence of large ground motions with compounding effects, (c) possibility of buildings not designed according to seismic code provisions, and (d) possibility of construction that did not comply with the design and specifications in the structural drawings.", "Compared to the response of buildings, other infrastructure performance was generally acceptable, with most of the bridges, roads and tunnels remaining operational, and no major issues with the power grid and water supply infrastructure.", "In terms of good performance, the 12 seismically isolated hospitals in the earthquake-impacted region were operational after the earthquakes, and more importantly, allowed these healthcare facilities to serve their emergency response functions in the aftermath of the extraordinary destruction.", "Seismic isolation was employed in these hospitals, as required by law for hospitals with 100+ beds in seismic zones I and II after 2013.", "Their operational performance was in major contrast with the observed collapses of some of the hospitals that were not seismically isolated.", "The objectives of this joint Preliminary Virtual Reconnaissance Report (PVRR) issued by the Structural Extreme Events Reconnaissance (StEER) network and Earthquake

via military helicopters and planes two days later.", "Reportedly, hundreds of shipping containers were ablaze.", "A leading global container shipping group, AP Moller Maersk, said that there had been significant damage to logistics and transport infrastructure specifically around the Port of Iskenderun, requiring that company and other shipping lines to divert containers to nearby ports and hubs.", "The earthquakes also caused damage to gas transmission lines and disrupted the energy supply.", "In particular, gas supply was halted in Kahramanmara\u015f, Gaziantep, and Hatay provinces and some other districts.", "In terms of economic loss, the ramifications could include the spoiling of food items requiring refrigeration (Daily Sabah 2023), but also disruptions to key industries.", "For example, the earthquake sequence has affected several provinces in the country\u2019s southeast, which is home to around 30% of T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s steel-producing Electric-Arc Furnace (EAF) capacity, equivalent to approximately 11.7 million tons per year of steel production.", "Iskenderun is an important port in T\u00fcrkiye for steel imports and exports, as well as for raw material, mostly steel scrap.", "Thus the port\u2019s closure, as well as disruptions in power and gas supply, caused steel production to be disrupted.", "Roughly 80% of these mills are long steel producers (wire, rod, rail, bars, structural sections), which could lead to shortages of a commodity vital for reconstruction.", "In Southern T\u00fcrkiye, members of commerce chambers, exchanges, and

leadership of AFAD, under the National Earthquake Strategy and Action Plan-2023.", "The T-SHM incorporated several new features and improvements that led to a more comprehensive assessment of the seismic hazard in T\u00fcrkiye.", "For example, the updated model includes smooth contour maps of seismic hazard in rock developed for intensity measures such as PGA, PGV (peak ground velocity), and spectral acceleration at natural periods of T=0.2 and 1.0 seconds.", "The return periods considered in the hazard maps of the 2018 model are 43, 72, 475, and 2,475 years.", "The 2018 model contrasts with the typical zonation maps that were previously used in the country, which assumed constant values of the plausible seismic demands (intended as upper values) within five zones with no consideration of distance from the fault.", "Before 1996, the zonation maps in T\u00fcrkiye were based on building damage or macroseismic intensity, and hence were more related to the observed seismic risk than to the hazard.", "These maps had no smooth transitions between known seismically active regions and \u201cnon-seismic\u201d regions.", "In contrast, the 1996 map considered PGA as the ground motion intensity parameter to define the seismic zonation within the country.", "Figure 2.9 shows examples of seismic zonation maps in T\u00fcrkiye developed in 1945, 1963, and 1996.", "Note the increase in areas considered with high active seismicity over the years.", "For the updated seismic hazard model (T-SHM), the researchers incorporated several important features for seismic source and ground motion characterization.", "In terms of source characterization, the model includes a comprehensive earthquake catalog that incorporates historical and instrumental data.", "The source model considers both areal and fault sources, complemented by background seismicity.", "For spectral acceleration-based intensity measures, these classified and ranked available Ground Motion Models (GMMs)

interpretation of the seismic hazard, which is consistent with the location of the seismic sources and the relative location of sites of interest.", "Based on the hazard map from AFAD, Figure 2.11 shows that the region near Kahramanmaras in T\u00fcrkiye has a high seismicity with a PGA larger than 0.5g throughout the zone for a 475-year return period.", "Zone 1 in red of the highest seismicity, pink, yellow, and light yellow are Zone 2, 3, and 4, respectively, of decreasing seismic hazard, and blank areas of no seismicity.", "The seismic hazard parameters were updated in the 2013 Syrian Code (Appendix 2: Seismic Design) to a PGA value ranging from 0.25g to 0.4g depending on the location and geologic nature of the region.", "Thus, currently the design PGA in Idlib is still 0.4g, but lower in Aleppo (0.25g in downtown and 0.3g in the West of Aleppo).", "Note that the 1,000-year return period is the maximum event that is considered in Syria, which is different from T\u00fcrkiye and the US where a 2475-year return period event is the maximum considered earthquake.", "The Turkish National Strong Motion Network (TNSMN), operated by AFAD, is the official strong motion network of

second earthquake (Mw 7.5 in Elbistan).", "The 6-story building in Figure 4.8 is a mixed-use building with a pharmacy and a grocery store at the first story, and residential occupancies at the upper stories.", "The window openings at the first story and the infill walls at the upper stories resulted in a weak and soft first story, leading to collapse of the first story.", "It is likely that the first story glass fa\u00e7ades were only at the front of the building, with infill walls at the back and sides.", "This nonuniform distribution of infill walls around the perimeter could have increased the torsional response during ground shaking.", "The 7-story mixed use RC building in Figure 4.9 likely collapsed due to similar reasons as indicated for the collapse of the 6-story mixed use building in Figure 4.8.", "It is located on a street corner with shopfront openings on both streets, and presumably solid fire walls on the back sides of the building.", "The torsional effects during ground shaking would impose large shear and bending demands on the front corner column (yellow color in Figure 4.9a).", "The video of this event indicates that failure of this column initiated total collapse of the building.", "Other examples of collapses due to potential weak/soft stories are provided in Figures 4.10 and 4.11.", "RC frames with unreinforced masonry infill walls is a common structural topology in T\u00fcrkiye.", "In low levels of excitation, these infill walls add to the stiffness and strength of the structure, providing beneficial contributions.", "However, even in cases where the infill walls are uniformly distributed along the height of the structure and there are no initial soft or weak stories, brittle failure of the infill walls due to in-plane/out-of-plane interaction can lead to the formation of soft stories during an earthquake (G\u00fcnay and Mosalam 2015), leading to eventual collapse.", "Considering the two strong earthquakes (Mw 7.8 and Mw 7.5) and the aftershocks between them, the formation of soft stories due to infill walls in the first event could have led to the collapse of these structures during the second event, as shown in Figures 4.4 to 4.10.", "It is noted that the infill walls of the collapsed buildings discussed above were not isolated from the bounding frames, which is the main reason why the infill walls were an important factor in the formation of weak and soft stories.", "Although the current version of the TBSC includes provisions for the inclusion of the infill walls for identification of vertical irregularities and suggests methods for isolating the infill walls from the frames, such isolation and inclusion of infill walls in numerical models are not required.", "Revisions in the TBSC for explicit consideration of infill walls and their isolation from the frames should be revisited.", "In some of the collapsed buildings, it is possible that the presence of soft and weak stories is accompanied by other characteristics of low ductility response (e.g., inadequate seismic detailing such as lack of confinement at the beam- and column-ends and insufficient transverse reinforcement at beam-column joints).", "The particular issue with the detrimental effects of infill walls at large shaking is not specific to only T\u00fcrkiye.", "In addition to their effect on the stiffness of upper stories, masonry infill walls, both at the exterior and interior walls of each floor, add considerable mass to the building, resulting in larger inertial forces developed during ground shaking.", "Poor behavior of RC frame structures with masonry infill walls was observed in several previous earthquakes in the world as well (Braga et al.2011; Manfredi et al.2014; Marinkovi\u0107 et al.2022).", "The 7-story building on a 2-story podium in Figure 4.12 is a mixed-use building, where the podium is used as a commercial space and the 7-story building has residential units.", "The first story of the podium structure has glass fa\u00e7ades and is weaker and softer than the second story of the podium.", "This is a potential reason for the collapse of this building.", "As observed from the right figure, all stories of the 7-story building collapsed, likely due to the impact of the podium collapse.", "The 2-story buildings in Figure 4.13 might have collapsed due to the combined effect of soft and weak stories and accompanying torsional response.", "An important reason for the collapses in the earthquake sequence is that such buildings were subjected to two large magnitude earthquakes (Mw 7.8 and Mw 7.5) and major aftershocks in between.", "Figure 4.14 shows a severely damaged building after the first earthquake that continued to collapse hours later during an aftershock putting at risk the lives of first responders.", "Modern principles of earthquake design were implemented in the TBSC, starting with the 1998 version of the code.", "The 1999 Kocaeli and Duzce earthquakes, which resulted in significant building damage and collapses, led to major changes in seismic design, which were further reflected in the 2007 version of the TBSC.", "Therefore, the buildings in the region can be categorized as pre-2000 (not up to date with modern seismic codes) and post-2000 (supposed to be designed according to the modern principles of seismic design).", "There is evidence that even post-2000 and post-2007 RC and masonry buildings collapsed.", "As noted earlier, there are several reasons for these collapses, including: (a) the ground motions exceeding MCE levels, (b) several large motions experienced by the buildings back-to-back in a sequence, (c) possibility of buildings not designed according to the code, and (d) possibility of the construction and material quality not following the intended design.", "Regarding the last two reasons, when buildings are designed as seismically resistant, some degree of repairable damage is expected due to higher earthquake levels than what was considered in the design of these buildings.", "However, when the shaking level significantly exceeds the design levels as the case here in this earthquake sequence, details of construction become a major factor to distinguish between collapse and other levels of damage.", "An RC residential building with shear walls, newly constructed in 2022, had a catastrophic collapse as shown in before and after images in Figure 4.15.", "Another new residential RC building with shear walls collapsed while it was under construction (Figure 4.16).", "In this figure, shear walls are oriented along one direction of the building.", "Extensive concrete crushing is visible at the shear wall base, denoting sliding-shear failure, as well as diagonal concrete crushing (e.g., refer to the third wall after the corner column), suggesting a combined flexure-shear diagonal failure.", "Furthermore, an axial failure of a corner beam-column joint is visible, with a possible under-design or shortage of sufficient confinement.", "Significant beam yielding along the orthogonal direction to the building lateral collapse in the shear wall direction might have led to shear and axial failure of the joint.", "Another building that has collapsed on its side is shown in Figure 4.17.", "There are several potential reasons for this failure: (1) Inadequate foundation, or (2) Initiation of the collapse of the structure from one side, resulting in the toppling of the structure.", "It is noted that this type of collapse due to the second reason is known as sidesway collapse, which occurs due to lateral dynamic instability at large lateral displacements, when the lateral strength of the structure degrades significantly.", "This type of collapse is different from the ones discussed in earlier images, where the RC buildings mostly collapsed by losing gravity load carrying capacity, much before reaching these excessive lateral displacements.", "This difference is conceptually demonstrated in Figure 4.18.", "The sidesway collapse might have occurred in buildings with larger displacement capacities, which have been exceeded by the large demands in this earthquake sequence, while the gravity collapse occurred in buildings with less deformation capacity (ductility) due to presence of vertical irregularities, insufficient confinement, weak-column/strong-beam proportions, or other characteristics of nonductile concrete buildings.", "In addition to the numerous failures shown above, Figure 4.19 (b) and (c) show that half of a 15- story mixed-use concrete building collapsed by separation from the other half.", "This collapse was reported to occur after a Mw 6.1 aftershock.", "From the top view of the building, an excessive reentrant corner can be seen in the middle.", "This reentrant corner could have led to excessive stress concentrations at that portion of the building (FEMA-P154, 2012).", "This may have caused the splitting of one half of the building from the other contributing to the collapse of the split half.", "It is also noted that the same reentrant corner is present in similar buildings in the neighborhood that are standing, hinting at possible other structural issues of this collapsed building.", "Another partially collapsed building is shown in Figure 4.20.", "It is possible that the failure in the corner of this building took place due to a combined effect of the two horizontal components of the ground motions at the location of the building.", "Increased shear forces due to plan torsion irregularity could have contributed to the occurrence of such failure.", "As discussed in Section 3, it is likely that most building stock in the earthquake impacted regions in Syria is non-engineered, poorly engineered, or at best gravity-designed non-ductile systems.", "The heaviest damage and the most collapses occurred in 4 cities in Syria (Aleppo, Latakia, Idlib, and Hama) and in 40 towns and villages in Northern Syria (Idlib) and its countryside (Reef Idlib), Aleppo and its countryside (Reef Aleppo)), with the most damage concentrated in Jendeyres near Afrin, and Harem near Idlib.", "As mentioned in Section 3, non-ductile concrete frames, non-ductile concrete ribbed slabs with hollow blocks and no drop beams, and non-ductile concrete flat plates are the most common RC systems for mid-rise buildings (all RC systems included heavy masonry infills) while the unreinforced masonry bearing walls is more common in low-rise buildings up to 6 stories.", "Many buildings in Syria that were damaged during the war are believed to have been rebuilt by individuals with low-quality materials.", "Such buildings are expected to be more vulnerable to collapse from earthquake shaking (Naddaf 2023; Mroue and Chehaeb 2023).", "There is past evidence of the collapse of war-damaged residential buildings in Aleppo and consequential casualties (Reuters 2023b).", "It is unfortunate that the ground motion records by the Syrian stations are not available by the time of publication of this report to help correlate damage to ground motion site spectra.", "Several unreinforced masonry multi-family buildings (low-rise and mid-rise) collapsed with a soft-story mechanism or out-of-plane (OOP) masonry failure as presented in Figures 4.21 to 4.23 (refer to shown arrows).", "Moreover, video evidence showed OOP failure of masonry infills leading to structural collapse.", "Non-ductile concrete construction presented severe damage and collapse in many instances and was believed to have caused the most fatalities and injuries.", "Examples are shown in Figures 4.24 to 4.35.", "Section 3 discussed the construction types and practices in the affected areas, which are important for better damage correlation.", "In some cases, a non-ductile concrete system is mixed with an unreinforced masonry bearing wall system within the same building, especially for the purpose of adding more floors to an existing building (refer to the building in the red rectangle in Figure 4.26).", "Severe damage before complete collapse due to low-quality materials made it sometimes difficult to distinguish from the debris a skeleton RC structure from a bearing wall system.", "For instance, while the rubble in Figure 4.26 may suggest all masonry construction, evidence of a few RC columns can still be detected as in the highlighted blue rectangle.", "It is evident from the partial collapse photographs that some older buildings in Syria were constructed with no gap to neighboring buildings of the same height, perhaps using the neighboring building as formwork for concrete elements (Figures 4.22, 4.23 and 4.27), which may have helped avoiding total collapse or preventing collapse in some instances.", "Pounding effects may have been relatively reduced due to such configurations.", "The diaphragm (floor slab) failure was commonly observed in many buildings (Figures 4.27 to 4.29, 4.32 and 4.33) when the horizontal diaphragm is unable to resist lateral forces during strong shaking or it is separated from the vertical system due to anchorage failure.", "The absence of slab integrity reinforcement, lack of continuity reinforcement, and poor anchorage to columns are evident in these figures.", "Very vulnerable slab-column connection conditions resulted from the absence of beams along with poor anchorage to columns, and in many instances, it is speculated that the collapse sequence was triggered by these vulnerable connections, as shown in the red rectangles in Figure 4.28.", "Pancaked collapse of multi-story non-ductile concrete buildings with ribbed slabs and no drop beams was widespread in Syria, more evident in Northern Syria\u2019s newer buildings constructed post 2012 war from low-quality materials as explained in Section 3 (Figures 4.28 to 4.35).", "Newer unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings also suffered extreme damage or collapse.", "On the other hand, old buildings of 2 to 3 stories in Syria (even made from adobe or stone masonry) resisted the strong shaking well, with some cracks and light damage, likely due to relatively higher quality of construction and materials prior to 2012.", "In concrete buildings that experienced severe damage or partial or total collapse, some common deficiencies can be observed from the collapse photographs, most of which are common in non- ductile concrete buildings, but some are considered excessive due to poor construction quality.", "Concrete quality/strength appears very low by visual inspection of texture and color, as well as the severity of crushing following collapse.", "Syrian engineers contacted after the event confirmed the low quality of the concrete used.", "This can be observed in Figures 4.25, 4.26 and 4.30 to 4.32.", "Thin RC column sections, suggesting no seismic design was conducted, and even in some cases appearing to be under-designed for gravity loads.", "This is common in non- engineered buildings.", "Thin columns can be observed in many damaged buildings; examples are seen in Figures 4.26 to 4.29, 4.31, and 4.32.", "Many buildings had lightly reinforced column sections, with no or little transverse reinforcement, and potentially inadequate lap splices located immediately above the slabs.", "Examples of such deficiencies can be observed in Figures 4.27 to 4.32.", "Absence of drop (projected) beams below the ribbed slab and flat plate systems.", "This creates a slab-column connection situation (no beam-column joints) which is known to perform poorly under severe earthquake shaking unless well reinforced.", "This condition can be observed in Figures 4.27 to 4.29, 4.32, and 4.33.", "Absence of seismic details throughout as seen on most photographs of damage.", "These include insufficient anchorage, development length, and continuity of slab reinforcement, and absence of integrity reinforcement.", "The orientation of the column section in several buildings is in one direction for all columns, rendering the weak-axis direction of the building, in the absence of shear walls, very vulnerable even to moderate shaking.", "These columns are often extremely thin in one direction.", "This can be observed in the columns at the right side of the building in Figure 4.30, the exterior columns in Figure 4.31, and all columns in the building in Figure 4.33.", "The use of heavy masonry infills either made of stone bricks or hollow concrete blocks.", "This practice results in high mass buildings which induce large seismic forces during ground shaking, becoming destructive in the absence of a seismic-resistant lateral system.", "This is a typical construction practice in the Mediterranean, Middle East, and Eastern Europe.", "Evidence of such practice is shown throughout this section\u2019s photographs.", "Figure 4.36 shows the damage assessment via satellite pictures taken by the UN satellite in the affected regions in Northern Syria.", "This aerial assessment can be correlated to the damage assessment conducted by Syrian rapid screening field teams.", "Several partial and total collapses of commercial buildings were reported in T\u00fcrkiye.", "In Malatya, Hotel Avsar (a 10-story RC building) and Trend Garden Residence (an 8-story RC building) completely collapsed (Figures 4.37 and 4.38).", "According to Google Earth data, the buildings had been renovated during the past two years and appear new.", "However, Google Earth imagery shows that the buildings have existed at least since 2001.", "Therefore, these buildings are in the category of pre-2000 buildings in T\u00fcrkiye that were not designed according to the advances in the 1998 version of the TBSC.", "This can be one of the reasons for the observed collapse.", "Malatya was close to the end of the fault rupture in both the Mw 7.8 and Mw 7.5 earthquakes, impacted by forward directivity.", "The large displacement demands due to the forward directivity effects during these two events and the strong aftershocks in between likely contributed to the observed collapse.", "Government facilities play a key role during extreme events like earthquakes.", "The continuing functionality of these facilities is essential.", "Some of the government buildings in T\u00fcrkiye experienced extensive damage and some collapsed.", "For instance, Figure 4.39 shows the collapse of a municipality building in Adiyaman, T\u00fcrkiye.", "Figure 4.40 shows the collapse of the first story and extensive damage to the second

from rural areas in social media, to date, there is only limited visual evidence of damaged unreinforced masonry buildings.", "At the time of writing this report, the rescue efforts are ongoing with difficulties in accessing rural areas.", "The immense rescue needs in the highly populated areas and the lack of access in reaching rural areas might explain the lack of visual evidence from these regions.", "With the available information, damage to a few masonry buildings is discussed in this section.", "Figure 4.41 shows the partial collapse of Ciftarslan House external enclosure wall in

writing of this report.", "Official reports highlighted that inpatient treatment services, ICUs, and emergency departments were functional.", "ICUs in Artvin State Hospital (Figure 4.62) were also put into operation to receive injured patients.", "Conversely, emergency healthcare services in the Pazarc\u0131k State Hospital (Figure 4.63) were delivered in a tent outside the building due to the non-structural damage to the main building (Figure 4.64).", "Even though the building did not collapse, the extent of diagonal shear cracks in the short wall elements in Figure 4.64a indicate that significant lateral drift occurred.", "This would explain the collapse of ceiling tiles (Figure 4.64a) and damage to interior walls and roof elements (Figure 4.64b and c).", "Several mosques (Figures 4.65 to 4.68) and churches, new and historic, were damaged or partially collapsed in T\u00fcrkiye due to the earthquake sequence.", "In particular, the city of Adiyaman suffered much of this damage.", "The Yeni Camii or New Mosque, in Malatya, was extensively damaged when its roof structure and domes collapsed (Figure 4.65).", "The mosque was constructed on the site of the former Hac\u0131 Yusuf Mosque destroyed by an earthquake on March 3, 1894.", "The mosque was reconstructed on March 14, 1964, when another significant earthquake caused severe damage to the building.", "There were cracks in the dome and some of its walls and the top stones of the cone fell off.", "The mosque was repaired as part of the restoration work carried out by the General Directorate of Foundations, and large minarets were also installed at that time.", "Figure 4.66 shows the partial collapse of Habib-i Neccar Mosque, Hatay, the first mosque in Anatolia.", "The dome was completely destroyed while the masonry walls and the courtyard roof partially collapsed.", "The long-span dome roof and significant vertical accelerations during this earthquake sequence may have contributed to the roof collapse of this structure, as well as the Adiyaman Ulu Grand Mosque in Adiyaman, T\u00fcrkiye (Figure 4.67), which also experienced collapse of the roof and most supporting walls.", "Collapse sometimes initiated in the walls however, with the roofs remaining intact, as observed in damage to a mosque in Kahramanmaras, Turkiye (Figure 4.68).", "It is likely that the long-span dome roof structures, with large open interiors and limited number of supporting columns make these structures particularly susceptible to earthquakes, especially those containing large vertical accelerations such as those observed during this sequence.", "The Cathedral of the Annunciation in \u0130skenderun has partially collapsed (Figure 4.69a).", "The Cathedral of the Annunciation (also known as the Alexandrian Catholic Church) is a Catholic church that functions as the Cathedral of the Apostolic Vicariate of Anatolia in \u0130skenderun.", "It was built between 1858 and 1871 by the Order of the Carmelites.", "After a fire in 1887, it was rebuilt between the years of 1888 and 1901.", "In \u0130skenderun, the St. Nicholas Orthodox Church was also severely damaged (Figure 4.69b).", "This church is a listed heritage

via Foreign Policy, 2023).", "The heavy dome roof appears to have been supported on a long-span roof supported by rectangular reinforced concrete columns with inadequate reinforcement.", "There was a varying level of structural response in this earthquake sequence from complete collapse to no damage and fully functional structures.", "For structures with light/no structural damage, nonstructural damage becomes important as nonstructural components and building contents can be costly to repair or replace impacting the building functionality and resulting in downtime.", "In addition, damage to some nonstructural components can endanger the life of people escaping the building and prevent the first responders entering the building.", "For instance, as shown in Figures 4.52b and 4.73, ceiling system and parapet failure can be a falling object hazard, and in some cases they completely shut down the egress of the building.", "Figure 4.74 shows the damage to the fa\u00e7ade of the Mersin City hospital in Mersin, T\u00fcrkiye.", "Vertically spanning nonstructural components and systems such as fa\u00e7ade, curtain walls, and the stair system are exposed to multi-support excitation due to attachment at multiple levels within a building.", "Therefore, it is essential to design these nonstructural systems such that they are drift compatible.", "Exterior and interior infill walls experienced extensive damage during the earthquake sequence.", "Figure 4.75 shows the typical damage of nonstructural infill walls.", "These types of infill walls are reported in many buildings with low to high level damage to the structural system.", "The building shown in this figure was carefully inspected by a team on the site, and the building is reported to have medium level damage.", "Proper design of nonstructural infill walls would mitigate the damage level to these drift-sensitive nonstructural systems.", "The structure in Figure 4.75 can be considered as a case where the infill walls provided beneficial effects to the structural response.", "Other nonstructural damage is shown in Figure 4.76 for items fallen off shelving units at a store in Gaziantep, T\u00fcrkiye.", "Moreover, Figure 4.77 shows broken window panes (refer to the arrows) of a building in Aleppo, Syria, due to out-of-plane accelerations, which can be a falling hazard.", "Stairs are the primary means of ingress and egress for a building during and after extreme events like earthquakes.", "Significant damage to the stair systems have been reported in previous earthquakes such as the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake (Li and Mosalam 2013) and 2011 Christchurch earthquake (Bull 2011).", "During the Mw 7.8 and Mw 7.5 earthquake sequence in T\u00fcrkiye, damage to stairwells and stairwell collapse were reported.", "As shown in Figure 4.78, the residential building received significant damage, but the building did not collapse.", "However, the residents of these buildings were not able to evacuate the building due to the collapse of stairwells.", "Therefore, the functionality and serviceability of these buildings were compromised, and the life of the residents were endangered.", "Significant damage to the Yesilhisar municipality building and stair flight was reported (see Figure 4.79).", "Yesilhisar municipality building is approximately 250 km away from Elbistan, and 290 km away from

an observation point during the Hittite Empire, fortified during the Roman Empire, and expanded under Byzantine Emperor Justinian I in the 6th century.", "Although the castle withstood centuries of invasions, it was badly damaged in this earthquake sequence (Figure 4.81) (NPR 2023).", "The unreinforced masonry walls present a significant mass that induces large internal forces during ground shaking.", "The shear strength of an unreinforced masonry wall is relatively low, and appears to have been exceeded in many areas around the perimeter wall of this castle.", "These walls often consist of neatly stacked exterior stone plies, enclosing loose rubble masonry on the interior of the wall as is visible in Figure 4.81 (d( and (e).", "This construction is effective against cannonball impact, but susceptible to collapse during ground shaking.", "Table 5.1 provides a summary of the performance of various classes of infrastructure.", "Specific illustrations of infrastructure

Highway.", "In several places, cracking of pavement (e.g., Figures 5.1(a-c)) due to seismic compression and vertical settlement induced distortional shearing caused surface failures (Figure 5.2).", "Vertical settlement of the pavement could be associated with the cyclic softening of materials due to large shear strain imposed by the earthquake sequence.", "Differential movement of a road near the Tevekkelli village on the Kahramanmara\u015f-Gaziantep Highway was also observed (Figure 5.3).", "This movement was measured to be approximately 3 meters.", "On February 8, 2023, Karayollari Genel
