{"Structural impact summary": "As of February 19, 2023, the number of reported completely and partially collapsed buildings was 28,362. 75,717 buildings and 306,563 dwellings were either collapsed or severely damaged. Around half of the buildings in the affected regions of T\u00fcrikiye were constructed before 2000. Damage to personal property is expected to be significant. Unfortunately, insured losses may be only around $1 billion (USD) due to low insurance coverage in the region. The impact of the quake on buildings is clearly dependent on location and location of the location. This does not mean that buildings at this location may be able to withstand this shaking without collapse, while sustaining moderate to heavy damage. The most vulnerable buildings are those constructed after 2000 and considered to be vulnerable to earthquake events. The 1999 Kocaeli and Duzce earthquakes, which resulted in significant building damage and collapses, led to major changes in seismic design. There is evidence that even post-2000 and post-2007, RC and masonry buildings were not properly designed and detailed. Many buildings in Syria that were damaged during the war are believed to have been rebuilt by individuals with low-quality materials. The majority of buildings were new and constructed following the lessons learned from the 1999 earthquake. The NEC added more seismic stations to the network reaching a total of 27 prior to the 2011 revolution and war. They are currently not connected with the central station in Damascus and are only registering the seismic events locally. The peak spectral acceleration reached 2.9g at a period of 0.85 s at Hassa station. In the N-S direction, the spectral accelerations exceed 1g for periods of 1.00 to 2.00 s with the potential of causing heavy damage in high-rise buildings. This aligns with reports that \u201cthe downtown district with taller buildings was hit particularly hard, while the city center had less apparent destruction\u201d In Syria, severe building damages and hundreds of building collapses resulted from the two main events and the aftershocks in Northern Syria. Several single-family and mixed-use multi-family RC buildings collapsed due to the presence of soft/weak first stories. It is likely that the first-floor fa\u00e7ades were only at the front of the building in Figure 49 likely collapsed on a mixed use RC building in Gaziantep city. It was located on a street with streetfront openings on both sides of the street. The heaviest damage is expected due to higher earthquake levels (Aleppo 4.9 and 4.5) and most of the collapses occurred in Syria. There were 11 hospitals within 200 km from the epicenter of the MW 7.8 earthquake. The Yeni Camoper Camii or New Mosque in Malatya, was extensively damaged when the masonry roof structure and domes collapsed. 200 houses in Mal atya province have been declared unusable. No damage was reported at Akkuyu nuclear power plant (Figure 5.11). This nuclear plant is under construction. The Hatay Airport is closed due to a surface rupture of the tarmac (Figures 5.7 and 5.8). This serves as evidence of the movement of a tectonic plate, probably at the fault location. The Banias refinery in Syria was partially damaged. The connectivity was not fully recovered as of February 8, 2023. After the earthquake, 3 of 9 stories of the RC - structure. Exposed reinforcing bars in beams and columns with evidence of corrosion. It was reported that the Hunutlu thermal power plant was undamaged. The main damage to this facility was to the concrete bases of the concrete equipment. It's reported that it has been reported that this facility has been fully recovered by the end of February 2023, but there has not yet been fully functional. The industrial facility with steel tanks was damaged by the quake. The damage to a steel facility with concrete bases was to a concrete base of the steel tanks. It\u2019s reported that there has been full recovery of this facility by March 2023 but there have been no reports of fully functional refineries. The damaged industrial facility was reported to have been partially damaged with steel bases with steel equipment. The buildings were apparently built with adobe masonry walls and earth slabs supported by wooden beams. In the pre-earthquake image, both parts were connected by middle-height horizontal panels, which coincided with the story heights of the right wing. This is particularly important because, during a seismic event, the falling non-structural elements can cause serious injury to people evacuating the buildings. The standing walls exhibit a vertical failure plane which may indicate the lack of horizontal bond elements and a poor connection between perpendicular walls. In several places, the castle withstood centuries of invasions, but it was badly damaged in this earthquake. It is noted that there was no damage to the BTC oil pipelines due to the earthquake sequence. A limited number of bridges were reported to be damaged after the earthquake. Extensive damage at the deck of \u015eekeroba bridge on the Kahramanmara\u015f-Osmaniye Highway and unseating and falling girders at an overpass at Nurda\u011f\u0131 were reported.", "Community impact summary": "As of March 8, the total official death toll due to these earthquakes was reported to be 45,968 confirmed deaths in T\u00fcrkiye and 7,259 deaths in Syria. More than 100,000 people were reported as injured. The earthquake sequence resulted in a very large number of fatalities and injuries. Extreme Event Solutions at Verisk predicted that the economic losses and industry-insured losses due to the earthquake sequence in T Turkey will likely exceed $20 billion (USD) and $1 billion ( USD), respectively (Verisk 2023). Reportedly, hundreds of shipping containers were ablaze. In Southern T Turkey, members of commerce chambers, exchanges, and industrial zones have opted to halt their production to provide aid to survivors. In particular, gas supply was halted in Kahramanmara\u015f, Gaziantep, and Hatay provinces. On February 7, the Ministry of Health reported that injured people from Iskenderun were transferred to Mersin City Hospital in ambulances. Ninety-eight wounded patients were transferred the day of the earthquake. Turkish Airlines (THY) announced that they would be offering free flights from Adana, Ad\u0131yaman, Gazianep, Kayseri, Diyarbak\u0131r, \u015eanl\u0131urfa, Malatya, Elaz\u0131\u011f, and Kahram anmara\u0159s provinces on February 7,. 2023, as part of their relief efforts. About 11,780 citizen volunteers, who went to airports to go to the quake zone following an invitation from AFAD, were taken to Adana,. GaziantEP, Adiyaman, and Urfa in 80 flights (Daily Sabah 2023b). Fatality estimates of the 1822 earthquake are in the range 20,000 to 60,000. The entire Syrian network was destroyed during the war except for the two stations in Damascus and Tartus. There is evidence of the collapse of war-damaged residential buildings in Aleppo and Aleppo. There was one casualty in this historical neighborhood, which was known as a symbol of the region. A significant number of critical patients were overwhelmed by the access to functional hospitals by helicopter as roads were damaged or access to the hospitals were overwhelmed. It was delivering emergency healthcare assistance in a tent at the garden hospital in Reylz\u00f6c\u00fcl. However due to sanctions, it was prohibited to receive receivers for these transmitters and these stations for the past two years. However, due to it being prohibited to receiver it was possible to observe the deaths. Internet connectivity was lost in all cities impacted by the event in T\u00fcrkiye. Aftershocks have caused planes to be grounded at airports throughout the region. Deformation of the railway tracks was observed between Kahramanmara\u015f and Gaziantep. Roads were also closed due to inclement weather that occurred immediately after the earthquake. 30 substations were damaged in the earthquake sequence causing power outages and blackouts reported in Antep, Hatay, and Kilis. The Port of Ceyhan is where the Baku-Tiblisi-Ceyhan (BTC) crude oil from Azerbaijan is delivered to T\u00fcrkye. The refinery was out of service. Phone lines were down in the southern provinces after the quake. Highly vulnerable structures with severe damage or collapse. Highly engineered structures with lower damage. Significant fatalities. Potential for prolonged downtime and recovery. Potential lessons to be learned from ground motion records and building performance. The Mw 7.8 earthquake occurred on February 6, 2023 at 6:29 pm local time. The reopening sequence for roadway closures is cataloged in Appendix A. The Tarsus-Adana\u2013Gaziantep ( TAG) Highway was also observed to have been damaged. Traffic was diverted to the D-400 state road (Demirci 2023) Over 30 electrical substations was damaged due to the earthquake, causing power blackouts in the area. The oil refinery was also out of action, and some roadways remained closed. The earthquake caused a leak in the oil pipeline from Azerbaijan to Turkey. The leak was fixed, and the loading operations have resumed (Perkins et al.2023). The oil pipeline was also affected by the earthquake and was shut down for a day. It is not known if the leak has been fixed or if the oil will be pumped again. The port is located in the Turkish city of T\u00fcrikiye, near the city of Adana. The city is home to the largest port on the Black Sea, with a population of 2.3 million people. It has a port that is used to transport crude oil and other products from the region to the rest of the world. The region has a long history of earthquakes and is prone to landslides and other natural disasters. It also has a history"}
