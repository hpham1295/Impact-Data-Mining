{"Structural impact summary": "Unlike Hurricane Charley (2004), water more so than wind was the impetus behind the disaster that unfolded. The impacts from Hurricane Ian were most severe in the barrier islands. Many buildings were completely washed away, and others left to deal with significant scour and eroded foundations. Seawall collapses were reported along the Atlantic coastline of Florida at Daytona Beach Shores. A levee in Hidden River in Sarasota County, FL, was also breached, causing severe flooding (Clowe, 2022). According to the National Levee Database, the Hidden River levee is a 1.98 mile embankment levee along the Myakka River. Mobile/manufactured housing and RV parks were the most susceptible to the damage. Wind damage was primarily limited to building-built homes in Port Charlotte, FL. Wind-induced flooding in the emergency room at HCA Florida Fawcett Hospital was rated EF3 by the National Weather Service. More severe damage appears to be focusing on roof damage, including roof damage on schools, with reports focusing on damage on the roof coverings. The surge impacted regions with high population densities housed in both elevated and on-grade residential structures, including mobile and manufactured home parks. It is notable that extensive losses were in part driven by decades-long construction boom of residential structures in Ft. Myers and Cape Coral since the 1950s and 1960s, expanding communities and neighborhoods encroaching upon vulnerable coastlines. In contrast to past hurricanes (e.g.Hurricane Katrina) that had uplifted bridge superstructures in multiple locations of the Gulf Coast Region, in this case the super Structures and their connections to the substructure (piers) were intact. The Sanibel Causeway consists of three bridges (A, B, C) and two islands (Causeway Island Park A, B) as shown in Fig.CS.5.4. In both cases the approach slab was elevated (same elevation with the bridge span) and was supported on backfill material. Backfill material was protected by wing-walls consisting of modular panels restrained by soil anchors embedded in the compacted fill. Since there is no observed erosion of the area, it could be hypothesized that the lateral hydrodynamic loads made some of the panels unstable. At the location with partial damage and scour of the pavement, the road was located further from the shore. This would consequently imply that while in the former case the road would be subjected to hydrod dynamic effects ( e.g., scour) immediately after the instant at which the surge and waves reached the elevation of the road. Many structures built at ground level, primarily those exposed to wave action, were completely washed away. Many elevated structures remain standing and show little evidence of exterior structural damage beyond removal of breakaway walls. Roof cover loss and flooding was frequently observed in churches, but no reports of structural damage have been found. Power infrastructure was more critically damaged in southwest Florida near the landfall area, causing power outages for several days. Power lines were typically supported by concrete poles that from preliminary observations seem to have performed well overall. There are reports of damages to agricultural facilities. A levee was in danger of failing in the Hidden River area, threatening even more extensive flooding. In Daytona Beach, there was extensive damage to the seawalls. Insured wind losses of $23-$35 billion. Uninsured flood losses $10-$17 billion. Zone A, all residents living on Don Pedro Island, Knight Island (Palm Island), Little Gasparilla Island, Gasparillas Island and Manasota Key, and all residents in mobile homes and trailers. All residents living in Zone A. The iconic pier was extensively damaged, and floating docks were twisted at Fort Myers. A section of Pine Island road near Matlacha Pass road partially collapsed. The Sanibel Island causeway was washed out. A collapsed cell tower was observed in Boca Grande, FL. The Florida Keys were severely affected by the storm. The damage was mostly limited to piers and seawalls damaged by storm surge in Florida. Damage to port facilities was limited to Piedmont and Fort Myers, with some isolated cases of damage to agriculture facilities. There was almost no damage to bridge superstructures. In contrast to past major hurricanes like Hurricane Katrina, there were no widespread structural failures in the Florida Gulf Coast area. The storm caused $8-$18 billion in insured wind losses and $5-$10 billion insured flood losses. It is estimated that the storm caused more than $20 billion in damage to property in the Tampa Bay area, including $1 billion in uninsured losses. The National Weather Service is still assessing the extent of the storm damage in the Keys and surrounding areas. It has not yet been determined how much of the damage is insured or uninsured. The Hurricane Center has not been able to determine how much damage was caused by flooding in the Gulf of Mexico. The hurricane-related death toll has been estimated to be at least 100, with an estimated number of more than 100,000 people missing or missing in the storm's aftermath. The death toll is expected to rise to more than 200,000.", "Community impact summary": "Storm-related death toll from Hurricane Ian was 125 as of November 10, 2022. Death toll included 119 storm-related fatalities in Florida, five in North Carolina, and one in Virginia. The majority of the deaths (57) were reported in Lee County, FL, and an estimated 60% were caused by drowning. Risk modelers estimated wind and coastal storm surge losses of $40-$74 billion. As such, Hurricane Ian will likely be one of the costliest landfalling hurricanes of all time in the US, claiming over 100 lives. The strong hurricane winds associated with Hurricane Ian caused widespread power outages in Florida. North Carolina had power outage of more than 358,000 (Dean, K. Cataudella, K., 2022) The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) reported that cell service outages dropped from 65.0% to around 5.0%. The total number of wireline/cable users affected in Florida dropped from around 320,000 users to around 110,000. As Hurricane Ian moved towards the northwest, causing intense precipitation with long durations, inland transportation networks of central and northwest Florida were disrupted. Direct impacts to hospitals and indirect impacts to supporting infrastructure forced 642 patients to be evacuated from 6 health care facilities in Charlotte, Lee, Sarasota, Orange, and Volusia Counties (FL Gov, 2022). Hospitals in the impacted area suffered severe staffing shortages due to displaced workers (FHA, 2022) Telecommunications infrastructure primarily in southwest Florida was not functional following the storm due to loss of power, flooded generators, and the collapse of a cellular tower. In at least one case, a cell tower in Boca Grande, Florida, on a business impacted both the telecommunication system and the adjacent building. The coastal roads to Sanibel Island were severely damaged, causing power infrastructure to be considerably damaged for several days. This includes all the bridges to Pine Island (Gallman, 2022), the roadway connecting Captiva and Sanibel Islands, the Sanibel Causeway connecting Sanibel island to Fort Myers. The Florida Department of Transportation was able to quickly restore access to barrier islands. Despite the extensive damage to several bridges and roadways in coastal and inland areas, the Florida Dept. of Transportation quickly restored access to Florida and South Carolina. The damage to citrus industry was much larger however, particularly the wind damage to wind damage bridges to the islands. The total damage to power infrastructure, notably downed power lines, was $46-$67 billion (excludes $1+ billion in insured inland flooding losses)"}
