= [\n","    'The impacts from Hurricane Ian were most severe in the barrier islands from the combination of storm surge and high winds, with many buildings completely washed away, and others left to deal with significant scour and eroded foundations.',\n","    'The damage was not restricted to buildings, as the causeways out to the barrier islands were washed away in multiple locations.',\n","    'In contrast, wind damage from Hurricane Ian appears less severe overall relative to other Category 4 storms, perhaps due to a combination of actual wind intensity being less than Category 4 at the surface at landfall, and the improvements in building construction that have occurred since Hurricane Charley struck 18 years earlier.',\n","    'Wind damage was generally less severe, but widespread roof cover loss and other building envelope damage will drive economic losses.',\n","    'The surge impacted regions with high population densities housed in both elevated and on-grade residential structures, including mobile and manufactured home parks, along hundreds of miles of canals and coastal frontage in Cape Coral, Ft. Myers, and nearby barrier islands.',\n","    'These solar panels showed good structural performance with no damage (), albeit under below- design wind speeds (90-100 mph according to the ARA wind field estimate).',\n","    'Beyond Babcock Ranch, however, aerial imagery from NOAA revealed damage to roof solar panels in areas that observed higher peak wind gusts.',\n","    'A preliminary assessment conducted in multiple neighborhoods in Cape Coral and Fort Myers identified 30 rooftop panel installations with severe damage (Fig.CS.5.1).',\n","    'Field inspections can reveal less visible damage to the panels (;  ), identify specific failure mechanisms (e.g., cracks and local failures in the rack, panel connection, or roof attachment), and evaluate the impacts on continuous power access and building functionality.',\n","    'Damage was also observed to coastal highways in Fort Myers, with the most characteristic case being McGregor Blvd.',\n","    'The most common pattern of failure was the severe coastal erosion near the causeways and roads that led to scour and partial damage (e.g., differential settlements) or washout of pavements and causeways, and the damage to approach slabs, as shown in Figure 5.3.',\n","    'Although many inland roads and bridges survived the flooding, some witnessed major damage, such as SR-37 at Manatee Polk County, experienced wash outs, while other locations experienced scour of roads and culverts (Wicks, 2022).',\n","    'A notable case is the failure of the Sanibel Causeway, experiencing three different types of damage at different locations (see Fig.CS.5.3).',\n","    'Interestingly, in contrast to past hurricanes (e.g.Hurricane Katrina) that had uplifted bridge superstructures in multiple locations of the Gulf Coast Region, in this case the superstructures and their connections to the substructure (piers) were intact and the damage occurred at the approach slab of both Bridge A (on the mainland side) and Bridge B (on the south side).',\n","    'In both cases the approach slab was elevated (same elevation with the bridge span) and was supported on backfill material that was protected by wing-walls consisting of modular panels restrained by soil anchors embedded in the compacted fill.',\n","    'These panels were exposed to lateral loads from the surge and the waves.',\n","    'Since there is no observed erosion of the area in the vicinity of the wing-walls, it could be hypothesized that the lateral hydrodynamic loads made some of the panels unstable, which exposed the backfill material to hydrodynamic actions and scour.',\n","    'Once the backfill material started undergoing scour, the vertical pressures that were applied by the backfill on the slab and helped keep the slab in place were reduced, essentially leading to a simply supported slab.',\n","    'Two other types of damage were also observed in the Sanibel Causeway, particularly ‘at the two islands.',\n","    'The first type was the partial damage of the pavements on the seaward side, which was caused by the erosion of the soil below the roads, and the second type was the total washout of the road with the island below it (see Fig.CS.5.3).',\n","    'On the other hand, at the location with partial damage and scour of the pavement, the road was located further from the shore.',\n","    'This would consequently imply that while in the former case the road would be subjected to hydrodynamic effects (e.g., scour) immediately after the instant at which the surge and waves reached the elevation of the road, in the latter case the road would be subjected to the same effects only after the sandy beach (on the seaward side) would have been eroded.',\n","    'Apart from this hypothetical explanation, other potential reasons that could have contributed to the different levels of damage are (i) differences in road elevations, (ii) directionality effects which may be important in the case of skewed bridge superstructures subjected to extreme waves (e.g., Istrati and Buckle, 2021), (iii) differences in bathymetry, or (iv) other reasons not evident at this point.',\n","    'Seawall collapses were reported along the Atlantic coastline of Florida at Daytona Beach Shores (Burbank, 2022), damaging surrounding facilities like pool decks and boardwalks.',\n","    'The seawall appeared to be lightly reinforced precast concrete with a height of around 10 ft and thickness of approximately 8 in.',\n","    'A levee in Hidden River in Sarasota County, FL, was also breached, causing severe localized flooding (Clowe, 2022).',\n","    'Poor connection between the seawall on the foundation played a prominent role in the collapse of the seawall.',\n","    'A levee in Hidden River in Sarasota County, FL, was also breached, causing severe localized flooding (Clowe, 2022).',\n","    'According to the , the Hidden River levee is a 1.98 mile embankment levee along the Myakka River that protects about 20 buildings along Hidden River Rd.'\n","]\n","s_para_c = [\n","    'As such, Hurricane Ian will likely be one of the costliest landfalling hurricanes of all time in the US, claiming over 100 lives.',\n","    'Several mobile/manufactured home parks on the barrier islands fared particularly poorly, offering little to no protection to anyone unfortunate enough to shelter in them.',\n","    'Tragically, preliminary numbers available at the time of this report confirm that Ian has caused over 100 fatalities in Florida, the highest direct loss of life in any hurricane
