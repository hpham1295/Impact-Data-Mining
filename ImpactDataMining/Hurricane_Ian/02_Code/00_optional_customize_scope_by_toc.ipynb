It displays the table of contents structure, enabling users to select sections they might want to exclude from the analysis. To exclude these sections, users should note the headings they want to omit and then specify these in the drop_headings variable within the 01_input.ipynb file, after reviewing the displayed table of contents. For those who wish to include all sections in the report can skip this notebook and proceed directly to the 01_input.ipynb file.
